One very important rule: no time travel! I refused to multiply my cognitive
load that much. :)

  The Rift Itself

  1. Rift modification mechanics: What KIND of controls are we talking about?

- Something plausible for ~400 DR. Has tech or magic changed in any meaningful
  ways in the last 100 years?
- It should also fit Netherese canon thematically. I'll need a lot of input
  from you on those aspects.
- I want it to be as different from the facility as is reasonably possible,
  except for the use of resonance, which to me is something fundamental to not
  just the story world, but all worlds ever, because it's as much a
  mathematical phenomenon as a physical one. A Fourier transform by any other
  name would work just as well in any world. And would smell as sweet. Hat tip
  to Shakespear.

I think I want to encourage the players to engage more with the town, so I
will make it obvious that it requires more than two people to operate. Since
the room is a cube, 4 (walls) or 5 (walls and floor) would be good numbers.
The participants do not need special training, they just need to be able to
follow directions.

It's current destination is like if an AM radio were tuned to a station and
then drifted off-frequency: it's the same, but distorted and farther away. If
they figure out how to dial it in, locations in the hells would be potential
destinations, but I like the idea that it could conceivably be tuned to ANY
plane, even a copy of Earth circa 2025 CE, though I would want that to be
extremely difficult to accomplish.

So I need a control system that is sufficiently complex to make it easy to add
new potential destinations. I also need to come up with some mechanics for the
tuning once they get past the puzzle part, kinda like the mechanics of the
Teleport spell where a nat 20 is never bad and a nat 1 is likely to be bad.
But unlike teleport, people have the option of whether to take their chances
going through or try again.

Ah, I also want to offer feedback on how well tuned it is. A well tuned rift
should be transparent, such that the other side is clearly visible and the
bounds of the rift are clear. There would also be no immediate risk from
interacting with a well-tuned portal. The rock that sheared in half wouldn't
have if the portal had been in tune.

Half of the danger of the portal is that when out of tune it leads into
non-planar destinations, like the spaces between planes and such. The other
half, of course, is what might come through.

  2. What can modification DO?

Ah, I got ahead of myself above. Some of that answers this. I envision this as
a multi-dimensional tuning system. I'm thinking it like the embedding space of
LLMs where no single dimension necessarily "means" anything but that a
vector composed of a particular combination of axes can control where in a
particular plane the other end is located and another vector can direct the
genre :)

There are also controls for the feedback loop that is used to stabilize both
ends of the portal.

    - Change destination to specific other planes?

Yes

    - Rotate through a fixed list of connections?

Just like how car radios have a way to save stations, this thing has a way to
save and return the end to destinations, and it will already have some saved
in it, but they will have been set 1000 years ago and may not be useful or
safe anymore.

    - Adjust "distance" (same plane, different location)?

Yes

    - Change size/stability of the opening?

You read my mind, though there need to be limits. I currently envision the
rift as being three-dimensional because it is the intersection of two (or
more?!) three-dimensional spaces embedded in a space that has at least four
dimensions to accommodate the existence of multiple three-dimensional spaces
within it.

Though, now that I think about it, maybe it should be a plane. Better yet, its
size _and_ shape are somewhat controlable. At the time the kids encounter it,
it's three dimensional because the tuning is off. When tuned properly it's a
two-dimensional surface with no depth. Its boundary shape can be any smooth
shape because it has to be describable with a polynomial function. There is a
zero-width plane where one side is 'here' and the other is 'there'.

    - Close it entirely?

Yes! That could be a sort of end-condition. If they were to use the controls
to sever the rift, and then destroy the mechanisms, it would take a monumental
and unknown effort to re-open it.

  3. The alignment test:
    - Is it a one-time check to reveal the controls?
    - Or ongoing (alignment shifts lock you out)?
    - What happens if wrong-aligned person tries? (Nothing? Damage? Corrupted results?)
    - Can both PCs attempt, or just one?

  Environmental Mechanics

  4. "It hurts to be here" - What kind of hurt?
    - CON saves every X minutes or take damage?
    - Exhaustion levels accumulating?
    - Psychic pressure from planar wrongness?
    - All of the above?
  5. How long can they survive there before it becomes dangerous/lethal?
  6. Detection: Can they tell from THIS side that it's hostile, or only by entering?

  Sera & Leilon Politics

  7. Sera's personality: How does she respond to weird magic stuff?
    - Pragmatic dwarven "seal it up and forget it"?
    - Curious but cautious?
    - Worried about workers?
    - Wants to impress Neverember?
  8. Payment for rift investigation: Should we tier this?
    - 15gp was offered upfront
    - Bonus if they solve it?
    - Ongoing payment if it takes multiple sessions?

- 15gp: What they've found so far
- 20gp: Figure out what it is
- 50gp: Figure out how to work it

  9. Sera's orders to crew: What are her priorities?
    - Worker safety first?
    - Continue construction elsewhere?
    - Seal the chamber?
      - post 24x10 guard
    - Wait for expert help?
      - And Neverember's input.

  10. Neverember's interest level:
    - Does this threaten his reconstruction project enough to come personally?
      - He's going to want to control it.
    - Send specialists?
      - Definitely
    - Just want it handled quietly?
      - Also that

  Netherese Details

  11. What do you want the Netherese to have been DOING with this rift?
    - Pure research?
    - Transportation network?
    - Energy extraction?
    - Containment of something dangerous?
    - Failed experiment?

Looking for magical resources on other planes

  12. Evidence in the chamber: What physical remnants exist?
    - Just the warning symbols?
    - Diagrams/schematics?
    - Inert magical apparatus?
    - Corpses/remains?

  Session 7 Structure

  13. Opening: Do you want a Jack lecture, or skip straight to "you're holding a warm javelin"?
  14. Expected session beats: What would you like to accomplish tomorrow?
    - Decision to enter or not
    - If enter: brief exploration and return
    - Discovery of controls
    - All of the above?
  15. Cliffhanger for Session 8: Any ideas what that might be?

  Start with whichever questions feel most urgent for tomorrow's prep!
