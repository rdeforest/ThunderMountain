# Professor Brightletter's Lecture: The Phandalin Incident
## University of Neverwinter, Autumn Semester 1495 DR

*The lecture hall settles as Professor Jack Atabar Brightletter enters, his arms full of scrolls, a peculiar goblin-made copper brooch glinting on his lapel. He sets down his materials with practiced chaos and beams at his students.*

"Settle down, settle down, young scholars! Put away those sending stones - yes, Master Thornwick, I can see you trying to message your sweetheart under the desk. Today we abandon our usual discussion of cross-cultural linguistics to examine a most *illuminating* case study."

*He produces a small crystal and taps it. An illusory image appears: a tavern sign reading "The Sleeping Giant."*

"Spring of 1492. I had just published my treatise on Cragmaw society - some of you may have suffered through it in your preparatory readings. My assistant, Miss Seraphina Moonwhisper, decided to pursue follow-up research. Simple enough, yes? Interview some goblins, document linguistic evolution, perhaps catalogue some new craft techniques."

*He chuckles, adjusting his spectacles.*

"What actually transpired was... rather different. You see, Miss Moonwhisper arrived at The Sleeping Giant Taproom in Phandalin seeking adventurers to escort her to Cragmaw territory. What she found instead were two of the most *peculiar* individuals I've ever had the pleasure of studying secondhand."

*The crystal shifts to show rough sketches of two figures.*

"First: Smol Bean - yes, that's her actual name, not a diminutive - a high elf sorcerer of noble birth who had somehow convinced everyone she was a security expert despite being, and I quote from Seraphina's notes, 'chaos in a tiny, angry package.' She worked for one Grista Kattelecopp, the proprietor, who had apparently adopted this wayward noble as something between a bouncer and a beloved stray cat."

"Second: The Songbird - dramatic pause for effect, as he would prefer - a human bard whose noble bearing was matched only by his obsession with legendary musical instruments. He had come to Phandalin chasing rumors of a magical trumpet hidden in the old Wave Echo Cave."

*Professor Brightletter's eyes twinkle with mischief.*

"Now, those of you who've read Chapter Seven of my book know that the Wave Echo Cave had been the site of rather dramatic events some years prior. What the locals now called 'Thunder Mountain' had developed quite the reputation. Grown men would cross the street rather than walk on the side facing the peaks. Children were told that if they misbehaved, the thunder would come for them."

*He pauses for effect, clearly enjoying himself.*

"So naturally, when these three met in that tavern - my assistant seeking goblins, the bard seeking treasure, and the sorcerer seeking... well, trouble, one assumes - the conversation took an unexpected turn. Rather than heading to the Cragmaw territories for academic research, they began planning an expedition to the very mountain that made hardened adventurers wake in cold sweats."

*The professor grins.*

"What followed was a series of events that challenged every assumption I had made about goblin-human relations, the nature of heroism, and the unexpected benefits of having someone in your party who can barely see over a bar stool but can incinerate said stool with her mind."

*He taps the crystal again, showing a rough map of the region.*

"But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let us begin with that evening in The Sleeping Giant, when Seraphina first heard the cackle of Grista Kattelecopp and realized her simple research trip was about to become something far more... educational."

*He settles into his lecturer's stance.*

"Picture, if you will, a tavern where the security is a noble-born elf who sits ON the bar rather than at it, where the entertainment seeks legendary instruments in cursed caves, and where the proprietor's idea of helping includes phrases like 'if you tell him there's a magic horn in it for him, he'll do whatever you want...'"

*The class leans forward, quills at the ready.*

"Thus began what I now refer to in my advanced courses as 'The Phandalin Incident,' or as Miss Moonwhisper calls it, 'The Reason I Now Always Pack Extra Healing Potions.'"
