# Thunder Mountain Campaign - Claude Context

**Campaign**: D&D 5e 2024 Thunder Mountain
**GM**: Robert
**Last Updated**: Session 6 complete, Session 7 prep complete
**Next Session**: Session 7 (tomorrow afternoon)

## Campaign Overview

**Players**:
- **Thunder** (Robert's niece): Smol Bean, High Elf Sorcerer 5, new to D&D
- **Kyle** (Thunder's boyfriend): Songbird, Human Bard 5, experienced
- **NPCs departed**: Seraphina & Thunek left for "the city" morning of Session 6

**Campaign Style**:
- Light, comedic, Pythonesque
- "Little Game, Big World" - intimate story, vast setting
- Player agency prioritized, sideways solutions encouraged
- 3-5 session arcs (Arizona move looming, ~20 sessions projected)

**Current Arc**: "Regional facility effects + excavation mysteries"

## Current Status (Post-Session 6)

**Location**: Leilon excavation site, outside Netherese planar rift chamber
**Situation**: Just poked detuned rift with javelin (warm, sulfur smell)
**Money**: ~25gp + session 6 payment from Sera

**Session 6 Summary**:
- Left Phandalin (told NO ONE about facility activation, not even Cragmaws)
- Scared off 5 dire wolves with combined illusion magic (no combat)
- Arrived Leilon, hired by Sera Hammerstone (15gp) to investigate excavation
- Discovered Netherese planar rift chamber (detuned, ~1831 years old)
- Cliffhanger: Holding warm javelin outside chamber

**Major Development**: Dagult Neverember received Sera's update, arriving TOMORROW to deal with rift personally, wants to meet party

## Key Worldbuilding Established

### Thunder Mountain Facility
- **Status**: Self-running on Ray's pre-death instructions
- **Operating mode**: Self-preservation, self-repair, self-defense, EXPANSION into lower levels
- **Power**: 5/6 generators online
- **Personnel**: Ray (wraith advisor, can't control facility directly), Primus-3R (modron)
- **Party awareness**: Don't fully realize extent of autonomous expansion
- **Foundation**: Built on ancient Netherese resonance enhancement (~500 years ago by dwarves/gnomes)

### Netherese Planar Rift
- **Location**: Leilon excavation, 20x20x20 cube chamber
- **Age**: ~1831 years (pre-Karsus's Folly, -339 DR)
- **Purpose**: Proof-of-concept planar transport (smaller version, larger one lost)
- **Current state**: Detuned, oversized from neglect, pointing to hell-adjacent pocket dimension
- **Psychic damage**: Rift feedback harmonics from being out of tune

**Control System**:
- 4 corners (max distance ~14ft from center)
- Unlocking requires 4 Neutral Good people touching corners simultaneously
- After unlock, 1 operator (any alignment) can tune destinations
- Crystals hidden in walls
- Performance/Arcana checks to tune

**Connection to Facility**: Both built on Netherese resonance foundation, separate systems

### Leilon
- Reconstructed town (1.5 years old, destroyed by Spellplague ~100 years ago)
- Lord Dagult Neverember's project (garrison + waypoint between Neverwinter/Waterdeep)
- NPCs: Sera Hammerstone (foreman), Gallio Elibro (Miner's Rest innkeeper)
- Songbird hired for weekly performances

## Session 7 Prep Complete

**Files Created**:
- `notes/session-7/planar-rift-reference.md` - Complete mechanics
- `notes/session-7/netherese-lore.md` - Background for questions
- `notes/session-7/session-7-cheat-sheet.md` - One-page quick reference

**Cliffhanger Options**:
1. Figure out rift operation
2. Leave town (bandit ambush)
3. Start inn business (players interested!)
4. 6pm bailout: Neverember arrives early
5. Discover Netherese-facility connection

**Inn Economics Prepared**: 1850-3700gp depending on approach, creative financing options available

## Active Doom Clocks

- **Noble B-Team**: 4/6 (Grandma Bean + Songbird's family coordinating)
- **Owlbear Migration**: 3/6 (15 owlbears toward farms)
- **Redbrand Ambush**: 2/6 (planning road attack)
- **External Interest**: 1/6 (facility news spreading)
- **Elder Thuul**: Wise enough to connect dots, knows party involved

## Campaign Information Gaps

**Party left everyone in dark**:
- Phandalin doesn't know what happened at facility
- Cragmaws don't know why weapons vibrated
- Only Grista got goodbye from party

## Context Files Updated

**contexts/ directory**:
- `campaign-state.md` - Current status, updated post-Session 6
- `active-npcs.md` - NPCs by location/likelihood
- `session-prep-template.md` - Robert's workflow
- `player-knowledge.yaml` - What each PC knows (updated for Session 6)
- `master-index.md` - Navigation hub
- `campaign-data.yaml` - Historical metadata (preserved)
- `dm_session_summary.md` - Initial planning (historical)

## Key GM Preferences & Rules

**Absolute Rules**:
- NO time travel (cognitive load multiplier)
- Resonance is fundamental (mathematical/physical, works everywhere)
- Player agency over railroad
- "Yes, and..." philosophy
- No homework for players

**Style Preferences**:
- Vertical alignment in code/notes
- Self-documenting over comments
- Minimalism (Occam's Razor)
- Quality equipment for GM confidence
- 3-5 session arcs for flexibility

**Collaboration Pattern**:
- Robert: Architecture, design, performance, decisions
- Claude: Implementation, worldbuilding, note preparation, asking questions
- Focus on questions to draw out Robert's vision

## Technical Setup

- Foundry VTT + D&D Beyond
- Physical materials when possible
- BOOX tablet for rules
- Jack's lectures as framing device (1495 DR narrator for 1492 DR events)
- Session every other Thursday, 3-hour target

## Important Canonical Decisions

**Facility Control**:
- Ray doesn't run facility (can't interact with it directly)
- Facility runs on last instructions (autonomous)
- Party has administrator privileges
- Expanding into lower levels to build larger forge (Ray's final design)

**Party Composition**:
- Just 2 PCs (Smol & Songbird)
- Martha/Maza did not materialize (player unavailable)
- Robert won't play party NPCs again (too hard at current experience level)

**Netherese Foundation**:
- Enhanced Thunder Mountain's natural resonance geology
- Dwarves/gnomes discovered and built on it
- Explains facility-rift connection without direct power link
- Rift chamber is proof-of-concept (larger version lost)

**Alignment System**:
- 4 NG people needed to UNLOCK rift controls
- Anyone can OPERATE after unlock
- Test reads recent actions/memories, not label

## Names Generated (Session 7)

**Male human**: Torvald, Edric, Brennan, Gareth, Kellan
**Female mixed**: Kathra (dwarf), Mardred (dwarf), Eldeth (dwarf), Brenna (human), Kerri (human)

## Next Session Priorities

1. Handle Neverember arrival (next day in-game)
2. Rift chamber exploration/decision
3. Possible inn business discussion
4. Cliffhanger by 6pm real-time
5. Keep options open for Session 8

## For Future Claude Sessions

- Always read `contexts/campaign-state.md` first for current status
- Check `contexts/active-npcs.md` for who might appear
- Use `contexts/master-index.md` for navigation
- Robert prefers questions over assumptions
- Worldbuilding should encourage player engagement
- Multiple valid paths forward always

## Campaign Strengths Observed

- Excellent organizational structure (00-INDEX.md control panels)
- 📍 cross-reference system works well
- "How to Be X" NPC cards perfect for players
- Jack's lectures = brilliant recap mechanism
- Players extremely creative (sideways solutions)
- Thunder getting exceptional first D&D experience

## Session 7 Ready State

✓ Mechanics documented
✓ Netherese lore prepared
✓ Cheat sheet created
✓ Cliffhanger options identified
✓ Inn economics calculated
✓ NPC names ready
✓ Neverember arrival planned

Robert will ad-lib recap. As long as players don't select destination and don't leave Leilon, prep is sufficient. If they do either, improvise within established framework.

Good luck with the session!
