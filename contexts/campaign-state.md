# Thunder Mountain - Current Campaign State
**Last Updated**: Post-Session 7 | **Campaign Date**: 1492 DR, Day 9 morning

## Current Status

### Party Composition & Location
- **Smol Bean** (Thunder): High Elf Sorcerer 5
- **Songbird** (Kyle): Human Bard 5
- **Current Location**: Leilon excavation site, Netherese portal chamber
- **Present NPCs**: Lord Dagult Neverember, 3 miners (Torvald Stone, Edric Moss, Kathra Ironfoot)
- **Immediate Situation**: Door to deeper Netherese base open, portal active and secured

### Last Session Summary (Session 7)
**Portal Activation**: Recruited 3 Neutral Good miners to unlock the detuned Netherese planar rift. Successfully activated control systems and tuned portal to functional state. Portal currently points to remote Nine Hells desert (safe, weeks from any threats).

**Base Discovery**: Discovered portal chamber is entrance to full Netherese spiral base. Hidden door revealed, leads to Level 15 of underground facility. Base is turritella shell design (spiral expanding downward), built by Low Netheril researchers as proof commoners could rival High Netheril.

**Neverember Partnership**: Lord Dagult Neverember arrived to investigate portal. Party negotiated inn investment deal: Neverember pays construction/staffing costs (~3k gp budget), party gets business ownership + 10% profit share for Neverember. Also hired to manage portal security. Neverember sending team of 5-6 planar specialists (arriving in 3-4 days).

**Portal Lore Learned**: Portal has 6 presets (Nine Hells, Seven Heavens, Feywild, Shadowfell, Astral Plane/Illithid ruins, Eberron). All point to remote safe locations by design. Finding new destinations takes months/years. Entire base population evacuated to Eberron during ancient attack.

**Cliffhanger**: Standing in portal chamber with Neverember and miners. Door to Netherese base open, ready to explore.

### Immediate Next Session (Session 8) - TODAY
**Opening**: Resume in portal chamber, decide whether to explore base
**Available Content**: Levels 13-15 ready to explore (junior researcher areas)
**Major Decisions**: Explore base now? Return to other plot threads? Use portal?
**Arc Theme**: Netherese mysteries + juggling multiple active threads
**Planning Horizon**: 3-5 session arc continues

- **Cragmaws**: Worried about vibrating weapons (party didn't tell them what happened)
- **Grista**: Only one who got goodbye, protective of Smol Bean as always
