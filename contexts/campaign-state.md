# Thunder Mountain - Current Campaign State
**Last Updated**: Post-Session 6 | **Campaign Date**: 1492 DR, Day 7 evening

## Current Status

### Party Composition & Location
- **Smol Bean** (Thunder): High Elf Sorcerer 5
- **Songbird** (Kyle): Human Bard 5
- **Current Location**: Leilon excavation site, outside planar rift chamber
- **Immediate Situation**: Staring at warm javelin that smells of sulfur after poking planar rift

### Last Session Summary (Session 6)
**Journey to Leilon**: Left Phandalin morning (Seraphina & Thunek departed for "the city"). Took grassland route. Encountered 5 dire wolves - scared them off with combined illusion magic (Mirror Image + Alter Self + Silent Image of 15-foot vulture). No combat.

**Leilon Arrival**: Evening arrival at reconstructed town (1.5 years old, rebuilt after Spellplague). Met Gallio (Miner's Rest innkeeper), hired for weekly performances. Met Sera Hammerstone (dwarven foreman), hired for 15gp to investigate excavation site.

**Planar Rift Discovery**: Found spherical rift (~7ft radius) in 20x20 chamber at wizard's tower excavation. Netherese warning symbols. Feels like "two universes grinding together." Smol poked with javelin → returned warm, smelling of sulfur. Appears to connect to hell-like plane.

**Cliffhanger**: Standing outside chamber with warm javelin, decision point ahead.

### Immediate Next Session (Session 7) - TOMORROW
**Opening**: Resume at excavation site, rift decision
**Major Decision**: Do they enter the rift? Investigate further? Report back?
**Arc Theme**: Regional facility effects + excavation mysteries
**Planning Horizon**: 3-5 session arc (Arizona move looming)

## Key Ongoing Situations

### Thunder Mountain Facility
- **Status**: Self-running on last instructions (Ray's pre-death orders)
- **Power**: 5/6 generators online
- **Operating Mode**: Self-preservation, self-repair, self-defense, expansion into lower levels
- **Expansion Project**: Building larger, more capable forge (Ray's final design)
- **Administrator Access**: Party granted themselves admin privileges
- **Personnel**: Ray (wraith advisor, can't directly control facility), Primus-3R (repaired modron)
- **Regional Effect**: All conductive metals resonated at activation
- **Party Awareness**: Don't fully realize extent of autonomous expansion
- [Facility Status](../lore/locations/thunder-mountain/facility-status.md) 📍

### Phandalin Politics (Party Left in the Dark)
- **Harbin Wester** (ex-mayor): Scheming for facility access/profit
- **Redbrands**: Planning ambush for "treasure"
- **Cragmaws**: Worried about vibrating weapons (party didn't tell them what happened)
- **Grista**: Only one who got goodbye, protective of Smol Bean as always
- **Information Gap**: Party told NO ONE about facility activation (not even Cragmaws)

### Family Interventions Brewing
- **Bean Family**: Grandmother scrying, coordinating with Songbird's family
- **Songbird Family**: Letters overdue, noble connections concerned
- **B-Team Formation**: Multi-family intervention squad assembling
- **Elder Thuul**: Wise enough to connect facility activation with regional effects, knows party involved
