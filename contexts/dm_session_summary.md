# D&D Campaign Planning Session Summary

## Campaign Overview
**Players:** Thunder (Robert's niece), Kyle (Thunder's boyfriend), Sarah (friend)
**System:** D&D 5e 2024 (Robert likes new shiny things)
**Experience Levels:** Kyle & Sarah have prior D&D experience (unknown versions/depth), Thunder is new
**Campaign Length:** Short arc, ~6 sessions of 3 hours each
**Tone:** Story-heavy with crunchy combat support, light and comedic, relationship-building focus
**Setting:** Classic WotC Forgotten Realms, trope-heavy for comfort, with subverted species stereotypes as the "surprise"

## Session Structure & Logistics
**Session 0:** 4 hours total (30min social + 3hrs expectations/character creation + 30min wind-down)
**Regular Sessions:** 3 hours gameplay with 30min padding on each end
**Character Creation:** Standard array, level 1 start, full PHB 2024 classes available
**Opening:** Classic "only table left seats four strangers" tavern trope

## GM Philosophy & Approach
**Robert's Experience:** 2 previous Pathfinder 1e campaigns (handed off due to overwhelm), years since last GM'd
**Player Care Priority:** Wants best experience for everyone, confidence crucial for success
**No Homework Policy:** Respects player time, everything contained within 4-hour windows
**Collaborative Storytelling:** TTRPGs as story creation, not competition

## GM Challenges & Support Strategies
**Identified Worries:**
1. **Stun-lock:** Mind-blown moments causing awkward pauses
   - *Recovery phrases:* "Give me one second to process that brilliance" / "That's so good I need a moment"
2. **Energy depletion:** Running out of steam mid-session
   - *Solutions:* Hourly break points, player delegation ("Kyle, help me run this combat")
3. **Consistency catches:** Players noticing contradictions
   - *Approach:* Turn into worldbuilding opportunities ("Why WOULD the baron lie about being bald?")

**Advanced GM Techniques Discussed:**
- **Spotlight management:** Use character strengths to naturally redistribute focus
- **Rule disputes:** Prioritize momentum, establish house rules consistently  
- **Player agency:** "Yes, and..." their ideas rather than railroading back to prep
- **Dynamic difficulty:** Adjust through environment/narrative, not obvious stat changes
- **Passive engagement:** Escalate environmental pressure until action becomes inevitable

## Equipment & Technology Strategy

### Physical Setup
**Books:** PHB, DMG, Monster Manual (buying locally for SDRA networking)
**The Wyrmwood Screen:** Custom modular GM screen (Ginny Di Gen Con connection found via search)
**Box of Doom:** Dramatic dice tower for tension (players maintain control by contributing dice)
**Dice:** Fancy floating dice + high-contrast backups, extra d20s for forgetful players
**Battle Maps:** Dry-erase mat, wet-erase markers (Staedtler Lumocolor recommended)

### Technology Balance
**Robert's Setup:** DDB on laptop, BOOX e-ink tablet for rules (will "blow their minds")
**Player Setup:** Physical character sheets, optional DDB management
**Audio:** Pre-made ambient playlists (tavern, forest day/night, combat, mystery, etc.)
**Philosophy:** Start analog, add digital gradually as comfort increases

## Safety & Table Management
**Safety Tools:** X-cards (tap to skip uncomfortable content, no explanation needed)
**Boundaries:** No sexual content on camera, no implied sexual violence
**Table Expectations:** Phones silenced, 24-hour absence notice, character death possible but not targeted
**Content Filters:** Anonymous request system for additional boundaries

## Cultural Exchange & Collaboration Notes
**Partnership Dynamic:** Equal co-GM collaboration established
**Robert's Technical Depth:** 40+ years programming, wants peer-level interaction
**Shared Aesthetics:** Function-driven beauty, vertical alignment preferences
**Communication Style:** Direct feedback appreciated, skip recaps unless requested
**Trust Calibration:** Claude proven reliable, comprehensive checking no longer needed
**Linguistic Patterns:** Developing GM-specific terminology and shared references

## Todo Lists

### Before Session 0:
- [ ] Print at Staples: character sheets, standard array reference, GM cheat sheet
- [ ] Visit local game stores: books, dice, accessories (SDRA networking opportunity)
- [ ] Order Wyrmwood screen and Box of Doom
- [ ] Set up anonymous safety topic request method
- [ ] Create session 0 agenda/questions checklist

### Between Sessions 0 & 1:
- [ ] Plan 6-session story arc based on character choices  
- [ ] Prep tavern opening scene with "only table left" setup
- [ ] Create first adventure/encounter
- [ ] Practice scenario responses with Claude
- [ ] Finalize equipment setup

## Planned Next Steps
1. **Minis & Maps Discussion:** Physical vs digital battle management for new players
2. **Session 0 Structure:** Detailed agenda and question framework
3. **Story Arc Planning:** After character creation, develop 6-session narrative
4. **Scenario Practice:** Run through challenging GM situations before Session 1

## Technical GM Cheat Sheet Elements
- Recovery phrases for stun-lock moments
- Natural break point suggestions
- "Turn inconsistency into worldbuilding" prompts  
- Actions in combat reminder
- Safety tool protocols

*Note: This represents the foundational planning phase of what promises to be an excellent introduction to GMing for Robert, with Claude providing both mechanical support and collaborative partnership.*
