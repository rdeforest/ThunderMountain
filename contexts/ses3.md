## Session Structure
- Each session opens with Professor Brightletter lecturing in 1495 DR
- He's telling the story of "The Phandalin Incident" from 1492 DR
- Natural recap mechanism and tone-setter
- Robert will use physical cues for different voices:
  - Jack: Hair down Einstein-style, adjusts spectacles
  - Seraphina: Severe bun, looks over glasses
  - Goblins: No glasses, wide eyes

## Story Setup
- Set in Spring 1492 DR, one year after Jack's book publication
- Wave Echo Cave area now called "Thunder Mountain" after failed adventurers
- Something is causing cave-ins in abandoned Cragmaw mines
- Jack wants to hire party to investigate for "evidence of past attempts"
- Seraphina pivots from goblin research to mountain exploration
- Party will seek Cragmaw scout as guide

## Important Context
- Both PCs have read Jack's goblin book
- The Cragmaws are sophisticated (can read, trade, have the book)
- Built-in rescue: Smol's wizard grandmother scries weekly
- Flexible pacing: Robert expects ADHD table, prepared for tangents
- No heavy themes unless players request in later sessions
- Focus on problem-solving over moral dilemmas

## Session 1 Goals
- Meet at The Sleeping Giant
- Establish party connections through Grista
- Pivot from goblin research to mountain exploration
- Potentially meet Cragmaw tribe
- Recruit goblin scout (possibly through demonstration fight)
- Reach mountain for cliffhanger if time allows
