And then I finish what I'm eating. Open my arm plmer.. I hope this thing will
hear you well enough.  You should be fine. I just worry about the background
noise from the fan. I'll speak a little.  Those are for if you were playing.
So this thing that you're looking at here is a tabletop simulator, virtual
tabletop. And these are hot buttons for like spells and items and things you
can drag your weapon there.  And then when you hit one, it'll do an attack....
And then there's also.. Oh, right.  I'm not actually a player right now
because I'm the game master. I did create players for you guys.. It's one of
the top ones.  This is popular. Watsi has their own that's not as good, but
it's integrated with the rest of their stuff, so that's kind) of nice. And
there's one that doesn't have system support, but it's 3D that's called
Tailspire.  Super popular. I think it's still an early release, too. All
right, so it seems like an eternity ago that uh a handsome bard wandered into
a small town in the mountains, called Sandalin, asking about a trumpet that
he'd heard about and met a couple of other people at the bar where he was
asking a tiny elf, which is not two words that often go together.  And a human
scholar and the bard introduced himself as the songbird and the elf introduced
herself a small bean. And the other human introduced herself as Seraphina. And
the three of them decided it would be fun to go look into these rumors.  But
first, Sfina had to visit the local goblins because she'd been in
communication with them and needed to close that loop. So you took the half
day trek over what was my mouse? Come on, mouse.  There we go. Over to here.
And, you met the Cragma tribe and impressed the mightily. learned some things
about the mountains, about how about the history of the mine and how they had
somebody had recently rediscovered it but not gotten in.  And that their own
scouts would be able to take you there. So, you made a plan to go, and
Seraphine and his friend whose name I've forgotten. That's how important he
is. tagged along as well because he wanted to.  And a couple of Mooks also
joined you, a couple of fighting scout goblins. And you went up to the
mountain and found an opening and fought in an Albert, only you didn't fight
it. Instead, you healed it, made friends with it, and now it loves you.  And
it wonders why you haven't come back. It's still up there. I say it, she,
she's still up there.  Mama, Mama Albert. You went in and avoided the bullets
that had been fighting with the owl bears. And you snuck up behind the
automated defenses of the facility, and then overcame the security system and
got inside.  And there you discovered a small mechanical creature that
appeared to be a mixture of cat, bat, and owl. I think that's right. And I've
forgotten what you named it.  Carl, that's right. You named it Carl. And in
this facility that you had gotten into, there were blue lines on the floor,
offering paths to things, and a map on the wall, which small Bean was able to
interpret because she speaks gnomish or dwarfish?  I think it was dwarfish..
Okay, Dwarvish. You decided to make your way to the control room on the way
you encountered and completely disabled one of the machines patrolling the
halls major way the rest of the way into the control room, started playing
with the controls..  The songbird, closed a door, which alerted a white to
your presence. who came through the walls because they can do that, to come
and yell at you. But But you quickly found common ground with the white, and
joined your party and helped you understand the facility a little better that
he was the spirit of the last survivor of the facility and had engineered all
of the defenses, and he helped you identify yourselves as full power
administrators of the facility itself, causing all of the robots to work for
you by default. You then set out on your search for.  Oh, that's right. You
went to first the Power Generation Room, where you found two out of six
generators working, and the white informed you, I don't remember what his name
was, that five were necessary for 100% power, six for backup power. And you
examined them and found what they needed, were able to fix one of them on the
spot.  The others needed stuff brought to them or done for them. So you went
off to go do that and fought something disgusting in one of the barracks. but
also found a mundane trumpet. And the white, I think, said something like, oh,
that thing.  He used to play that dumbest times. Anyway. Kept that with you.
went on to fight the.  I forget what it was called, but basically the head of
all of the spore colony that had been in growing in. Then you went on to find
a robot that had become disconnected from the facility, but was still
operating on its programming to maintain the crystal extraction area, growing
area you were able to make friends with that robot and reconnect it to the
facility, which caused it to go into repair mode. It went off to get itself
fixed up and you gathered the crystals you needed and went back to the power
room and got the rest of the generators running.  I had no idea there was this
much story. Holy cow. Yeah, a lot.  I'm glad we're doing a complete recap,
though. Yeah. It's gonna really help me remember the flavor and stuff.  I like
continuity. Let's see. H been restored all of the power, the facility went
into, it's sort of rebooted.  And you didn't know at the time, but that caused
it to light up brilliantly and make a noise that was felt for miles around.
There was no chance of your awaking it being a secret.. You then decided to
make your way out, and in order to avoid any of the risks that you'd pass by
on the way in, you use the map to find a way out that would bypass them.  But
guarding that, well, not guarding, but hanging out, loitering at that
location, were some Thunder methits, which like the boom room, they were there
because they liked the acoustic properties of the room they were in. You ended
up finding them, and chasing them off, and then the robots of the facility
finished them off. Once again solving problems with sideways solutions that I
love.  But afterwards, I went to Claw and said, I've got to come up with
better challenges.. What you guys crushed it. I'll say that.  I was
impressed... Usually with these two, I come up with three different ways that
I can think of that you could solve them, and you guys come up with the fourth
way. And I think about it in my mind.  I think about the mechanics, the
system, the world, and everything. I'm like, that would totally work. You've
done that so many times.  I can't even count. Yeah, what if I make this
illusion that makes it so that they all just fuck right off? Okay, yeah, that.
 Let's see if they believe. Yeah, they totally believe it. Yeah, that's a
Tuesday.  It's a day ending in why. Um. So you made your way through that
tunnel and found that it came out halfway to town and you made your way the
rest of the way to town using your excellent navigation skills.  And on
arriving late that night, you were informed that all of the metal in town had
reacted to the reboot. They didn't know it was a reboot. They just said there
was that the mountain lit up.  It's not currently lit, but it was lit at the
time. And all the metal wiggled or pointed at the mountain or something. Well,
only the conductive metals, and there are such a thing as nonconductive metal.
 I think. You probably know more about that than I do because of your material
science. Do you forget everything?  As soon as you got your diploma, you're
like, "All right, dump that." Got the paper, that's all I wanted. We gonna
hang out again sometime so I can find out all about your work and ask you all
the stuff I'm curious about.  I am. I' love to hear about people's stuff. Uh.
 Also in town, they informed you had a message that Small Bean had a message
from someone and it was her grandmother who had sent a sending courier
combination saying don't activate the facility, I think is what it said, or
something like that. And you're all, my bad. Yeah.  That twist was Claude's
idea, by the way.... And you slept, and the next morning, you talked to some
people about all of the we goings on, and thought about what to do next
thought about how the whole freaking planet is gonna be reacting to this
event. I did have to keep telling Claude not to take the story so far, so
fast.  And then I let that one slip through, so. I didn't really think it all
out. GMing is hard, you guys.  Um, people loaned you a map, looking a lot like
this one. so that you could play on your next plan. You learned that one,
what's his name? Oh, never, never something.  I'm not the gret for it. One
moment. What?  That's not right. Sorry. should be in here, maybe. Oh, no, I
remember it was.  He's from Never Winter and he's a big shot wealthy, powerful
well regarded amongst good people, good aligned people he ah, there it is
never ember is his name. I don't know if that's a canonical Dungeons and
Dragons thing or not, but Never Ember. You heard that there was some
devastation in Leylon and he went down to rebuild it because it's important to
have stable towns on the path between neverwinter and Water deep, which is
what that road is.  If I zoom out, in fact, I won't be able to show you water
deep on this map, but there's never winter. E, it's too fast. And right
around, down here somewhere is water deep.  And they are So there is a game
called Never Winter Nights. That's how famous Never Winter is. And Baldur's
Gate 3 is largely set in Water Deep..  And if you haven't seen Baldur's Gate
3, it is a gorgeous game, and I do recommend it. And now you've been doing
some of this stuff, you'll get all of the. It uses the same system.  It uses
the D20 system and so it'll all be familiar to you, in that sense. If you
decide to do that.. Yes, you decide that heading to Leylan would be a good, I
don't remember what you're thinking was.  I think you wanted to explore the
grandma thing. The note from your grandmother? Yeah.  Yeah. Oh, I remember. I
wanted to get more, like, information on other towns or dancing now that.
 With the metal? Yeah. Yeah.  I see, like, what. Yeah, I'm sure that they have
a few things to say there, since they have they're in the middle of doing this
excavation and rebuilding and stuff. We were kind of keeping below like the
goblins, like Oh, that's right.  Their weapons were glowing and more so the
closer they were together. And I just want a good story small being provides a
good stories. I' That's right.  I need to look at the timers. I have a page
devoted to when things will happen one way or another there we go it's. Can I
navigate from here?  Oh, that is not much help.. I've already forgotten what I
was looking for. Okay.  Oh, thank you. That's what it was. That is exactly
what it was.  Doom clocks the file is called. Oh, no.. Sorry, I just got a
message from a coworker.  Got to make sure it's not requiring my attention
Hmm. Okay. Wow, this is for session five.  It has not been. Oh, this is
starting at the I really need to pay more attention to this stuff. Oh, yeah, I
remember that.  I meant that. Yep. Okay..  Okay, let me look at this too. Oh,
good, this page does exist. Yeah.  All right. Yeah, you've got some time,
somewhat. All right, did you want to go?  I think you said he wanted to go
straight this way to the road. Okay. I prepared in case you changed your mind
and wanted to take the road.  But either it's fine. It does. I didn't prepare
it.  Claude prepared. I like to support player agency. I don't want you to
feel like you can only do one thing, because that's what I prepared for.
 Like, if you said, let screw this Laylon thing, I want to go through the
mountains, I would add lib that. I'm totally add with that. It'd be hard, but
I'd do it.  Okay. So, let's begin. Oh, anything else you want to do in town?
 I have this little alleys thing and I have the bigger screen that you've
already seen or math. So if you want to do anything there, that would be ready
to go. Good call.  I'm going to rely on you to keep track of that, because I
don't know where I would look at. That's the one. Go ahead.  Is it advantage,
right? I think it's at a D4 at any roll. Okay, yeah.  Yeah..... Small bird. Sm
So..  And let's see here. I got to look at my.. I gotta look at my notes to
see Iotten.  Where is the there it is the journey grassland trek that's what
it's called. And you're gonna be you're gonna be on the road or on in the
weeds for a day like overnight. You'll have to camp to get there.  Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, so before leaving town, let's go ahead and be back wall. I can't
turn that feature off.  It's ridiculous. It turns the icon around the point in
the direction that it went. Where is that?  That's appearance image, path,
dimension shape, that anchor scale, mirror, tint, dynamic token in the ring,
no it has nothing to do with the token ring network prototocol. I don't know
if that's what you're thinking. Huh.  All right, well, I don't, no. That's
I'll have to fix that later. Um..  There we go. Yes, okay, so food and
reagents, let me look up the Look up some let's look up. I'm looking for some
prices.  Oh, you know what? I'll just get to. bugs.. I think I want the DMG,
but it might be in a PHB.  Check in. There we go. It's in the page B, chapter
6.  And I will pass this to you in a moment and you can go shopping I'm not
gonna bother with any interesting differences in prices because of being in a
remote village or anything. But anything that you wanted to get that were
super fancy, it would have a we could have that here in a few days kind of
thing. That's a weapons, armor.  But the town is on good terms with both of
the major cities and north and south, so they can technically get you
anything. Venturing here, I think, is that where food is? That's not all of it
is.  Oh, I see, it's two poems. Dean. What's it called?  It's rations. There
we go. Okay, so rations is on this list.  And you can just go ahead and look
through that, and while you look through that, I'll try to get my get my shit
together water They give the weight because. What's that? Doing stuff for
people, stealing it..  Oh, did you guys get anything from the facility that
you could have hawked? I don't I don't think you found anything. Yeah.  I
don't think I left you anything in there either. I think there probably should
have been something. But they would have been so it was 500 years ago.  I'll
tell you what. You would have been able to, and I think had the wherewithal to
ask the facility for an inventory and been able to, without even searching,
find out where any money was. And there would have been some And we'll just
call it We'll call it 10 gold pieces.  Yeah, split between the two of you.
That's the equivalent of $500 in today's money. Roughly.  Yeah, the times that
I've attempted to come up with a conversion ratio, it's come to about $50 to
one gold based on how much the equivalent things cost in our world, like
crossbow and stuff. It doesn't work perfectly, but I deal. If it's not on
here, really make up a number for What are you looking for?.  Somebody just
gives you some. Oh, put those. I'll make it more immersive.  The small beans
friend, the innkeeper, has just bits and bobs in her office. and is happy to
share with you because you're taking good care of small bean. Or she's taking
care of you. Hard to say which.  This is what I was looking for. Yeah, that's
good. I've forgotten what the scale is on this..  God and I have a bag of sand
oil, you a glass? What is my glass? Oh my god.  I'ass. just did the math
again, and you won't have to overnight if you if you don't dawdle it it only
take you eight hours. a rock. Oh, r Oh, you did hear that there's lots of work
to be done at Leon. If you wanted to get more gold there.  Yeah? As long as
you don't try to do an impression of them. Or play them on your phone.?  Yeah.
I got some. All right.  So, uh, you say you goodbyes and head out still in the
morning. It is five it's the town is kind of close to the mountain, so that
part is kind of rocky. me just go ahead. And then as you come over here, you.
 Ooops. It's trying to oh, it's this one. Ah, there we go.  Um. Don't eat. You
don't sleep.  I you trance. You trance instead of sleeping, and it only takes
four hours, but you do have to eat... I don't. your in your lazy.  Yeah.
That's right. I don't want.  I was about to roll the dice on screen, and then
I realized I didn't want to do that. in the argument. So it's it's wild
grasslands. you're seeing game trails, different amounts of foliage, depending
on how close it is to the water table. It's kind of mildly hilly.  Neither one
of you is a geographer or geager. geologist. So I don't have to worry about
that. And the first two hours are trouble free..  You are unimpeded. It gets
to be a bit thicker, grass is. Well, you can barely see over it, small bean,
unless you're riding on his shoulders or something.  Okay.. Just bring up.
Thanks, small being up..  Burden bean. I'm birds in the be the beans. Hey, o.
 Um, let's see. I don't have you both roll a D20, but I'm not going to tell
you what for. Critical bail.  Okay. Do I add anything to that? I do, but I
don't tell you what it is.  Okay. All right. Eight.  Where was it here? Nope,
here we go. Uh...  So the next two hours are also no big deal. And then. Okay,
well, they failed.  You spot motion way off in the distance. Not you can't
tell what it is, but you see something over there is moving.. It's probably a
few hundred feet away.  I'm trying to get a sense of scale. Yeah, no, it's
more like 300 like a football field. 100 yards. at least. But.  Like, there's
no wind and yet the grass is waving and only in a certain spot. And it's
coming towards you. And then you notice that it's not just one.  It's they're
like two bits of grass that are coming towards you. They've got a grass that
they It's not snakes. Um.  Yeah, do you guys want to adjust your tactics at
all? You don't need to, obviously. Just I have to check.  I don't All right.
Um, are we gonna do a roll for what is the possibly? You can absolutely do
that.  That would be a survival check. Two. It could be, could be birds.  It
could be. It's wolves. Oh, as you're looking at them and you're seeing their
motion, you recognize, you recognize from your travels the telltale signs of
them stalking you.  They're trying to do a pincer movement. They're trying to
flank you. So there's two sets of them and they're not coordinating with
sound, they're just coordinated.  They've done this before. God, with 24, not
to give me perception for that. I had to think about it..  How I am. There's
in each, oh, I don't remember the actual there. There's at least two in every
group or both groups and possibly as many as three in one or both groups.  Am
I counting that right? Maybe six, somewhere between four and six ish. But you
definitely saw a tail, a little bit of gray in the yellow, the yellow and
green grass.  There's a little bit of gray that flashed by and then went away.
They are gonna go over to the other location. This is gonna be on the road.
 Oh, looks like I need to add another thing on here. Oh, we're not supposed to
see those. Well, that's all right.  You can see them. There's gonna be five. I
need to add another one, though.  Can you roll for animals? You're not that
close to them.. What do you want Actually, rather than worrying about what you
roll for, what do you want to do and I'll figure out what the role is., I'll
shoot it for a bird that take a I don't think I can Something that Yeah.
 There we go. It's just me and you, right? It's just the two of you.  You
don't have any Serafina or what's his name? Tik. I can talk to I like music?
 Who doesn't like music? What the heck? scale?  I don't. Ah, I need to turn.
Okay, I'll have to do this a different way.  I'm going to have to copy them
all and then put them here. There we go. They are afraid. normally, but right
now, they have this problem.  You may recall the an actual giant vulture was
the last thing that came after you guys. So it started with the pigs, then the
wolves, and the giant vulture was coming. And then you made it look like there
was something on the ground that if a giant vulture's like, eh, maybe not.  Or
something like that. So this is going to go over here and these guys are going
to go.. Yeah. work.  So a role for intimidation? What are you doing? Are you
going to try to scare them?  That would be.. Are you trying to convince them
that you're a vulture or just be a badass? I' just trying to keeping in mind,
you're about this tall.  Well, I' Oh, that's true. Okay. So, yeah.  So you're
playing.. I'm also going to do this organ make pounter sounds with her on top
of my. So a dire wolf takes up three hexes.  It's like Dire Wolf is almost as
big as a horse. It's not going to be impressed, especially because it's got
its regular wolves with it. And I'm telling you that because you're pretty
good at nature.  I got to get tokens for you guys on here. Actors.. What?  I
will do mirror image. Would that count with you on me, too? Would it be a
mirror image of us or just me?  You would ask a question like that, there
could be four. Let me read the spell description. and then it's it's almost
even number. Let me see.  If you pull this off, I'm just. Oh, they' oh, I put
that. I get tot up almost.  You think that would be scarier if we're straight
up? Because they're mirrorring. They could put put them on top of us This is
why I hate magic.  It doesn't. So I was going to be like, well, what does it
say about your clothes and stuff? It doesn't say anything.  It says,
duplicates of yourself appear in your space until the spell ends, the
duplicates move with you and mimic your actions. So they're not even in other
spaces. It's like in your five foot area, there's all these overlapping you.
 So I don't, I think it's just you, and I think the way that it works is..
yourself. Hmm. What does that do?  I think grow claws and fangs and horns.
That would be. do that. Some of me.  And then you. Would it count to clone? I
don't think you can clone another person.  It's not actually cloning. It's
just an illusion, and I think the illusion depends on. It's a trampter, it's a
trick of the eye in which you're using Because you're a bard, you You're
putting on a very special performance that makes it look like you're multiple
people at once.  I'm going to put then But then what would it. That doesn't
make sense, because then they'd be able to tell which one of you was real, by
which one Small Bean was on. It has to be both of you.  You bastards. are
connected. Cool. Yeah, it's both of you.  And I do. Then, yeah, your altered
self will be... Then can I also alter Kyle?  What is Hold on.. Jesus.. You
alter your physical form.  Oh my God. So we're whatever you are on top of me,
we'reure on top of you, and it's us. And I haves.  Yeah. Yeah what? We're
gonna have to fight some an afternoon.  This is. I'm going to say... Since
it's shapeshifting, I'm going to say that it applies to you because the U is
not your clothes.  It's it is. So your clothes won't be shifting. You'll just
look like whatever you're picking, wearing your old clothes.  Yeah. Whatever
those are. We haven't really talked about. what you guys are wearing.  I do a
silent image of a 15 foot vulture on top of the. Okay. And I'm going to grow
claws Okay.  I got to roll there. That is intimidation, yes. Or performance,
if you prefer, I would allow that, because you can do it different ways
andance.  All right.. Yeah, that's why I mention is.. Perfect.  All right, you
guys roll those, but don't tell me yet, because I got to figure out what the
results mean before you tell me. You' Oh, what are their stats? I need to look
that up, too.  I should have had that up already. Oh, that should have been
linked from this page, but it's not. All right.  Oh, Robert. I swear. I don't
know what to do with you guys sometimes.  The war is spells, the crazy. Wait a
minute. totem with me having claws and you put a mtra on my head. I mean, I
could I could make an image of you speak with animals and press the vegetation
for the smell, sound of the wall.  And I'm telling them, you know, back off.
Yeah. He's not working.. a giant pool.  Yeah. I am your. I'm gone.  Yeah, I
Where's you gone now? You must submit to this be. G..  Bard? Bard bean, yeah.
The bean and the bard.  Let's get to the nail and sort of that's just never
leave I would run that game. Yeah. If you decided you wanted to run run a
pub.venture Absolutely.  Adventurer setting up a successful business sitting
down. Yeah. If you guys decide you want to take a turn in that direction, it
could totally happen.  But your previous lives will continue to haunt you.
What are you going to do with the facility? Are you going to have it at the
facility?  Let's see. I need to look up Dyer Walsh and regular Wolf. There's
Dyer Wolf.  There's regular wolf. How smart are these? This would be a wisdom
check.  Oh, they're pretty wise. Okay. So they're going to roll Let's see.
 It's going to be contested roll. Their wisdom against your two things that
you did. Oh, let's see.  Wisdom checks are Oh, it's just a stat. Okay. So they
have the same.  This is going to be Yeah. It's a fucking one. No joke.  I. I
don't even have to roll for the other four because they're going to follow
leader. The leader whimpers. howls. Yeah, what?  And they run. I do you have
claws? Yeah, and then there's a 15 foot vulture on top of and you're making.
 Well, you're also surprised them, because when they first saw you, you were
just two people, one on top of the other. And then suddenly! They're like,
"We, we are out of our.  This is out of our league. I'm not paid enough for
this. Jesus.  That's enough. She's very good at her balls. They would have had
to roll.  It would have taken a crit success to match that. They're plus two
on Wisdom. she's done before. This is why this is why she's got such an
attitude.  She's just used to people being like, oh, shit, I'm out of here.
Okay, well, that was the fastest combat ever. We didn't even go to an
initiative.  I guess we'll go back to the Sword Mountains. that. That's all
right. We'll just....  Who that? I got to think about these things in advance.
I got to think, what if they try to.  I don't know. That's why I can't even be
mad. Like, there's no way I would have thought of that.  And it's totally
legit.. And you were using a can trip for your thing. You.  No. Ultter self is
a spell. Okay, so you marked that off.  I did. Good.. You're good.  Yeah. All
right, I'm just going to take you into town here. And now we're going to go.
 Yes. Excuse me.. Well, it's a good thing.  I didn't spend a whole lot of time
figuring out how wolves work. I'm having a blast, though. I'm I'm being
dramatic 'cause I think it's hilarious. dramatic Yeah, and that's true, too.
 It's just how we are. I have to find my notes on the town now. What?  Yeah.
You didn't get your pet, either. But you know where to find some moles.  Yeah.
I. I''ll see what comes up. If you got a dire..  That'd be a big deal. I have
to do some research because I'm I'm pretty sure I'm not hold on. Let me just
go back to that Dire Wolf page.  I think it would be. I think I'd have to do a
custom one for you that's bigger than usual. So it's it's CR1, which means
Wait a minute.  I think we underscaled that. No, no, I remember. All right. if
one of you met a dire wolf by yourself, it should be a hard fight.  That's how
tough they're supposed to be, I think. You'd still be probably assured success
if it were by itself. It's the working together that makes them more powerful,
the packact tactics.  I think that, yeah, they have a it's a Pac tactics, the
wolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature, if at least one of
the wolves's allies is within five feet of the creature, and the ally doesn't
have the incapacitated condition. So that's how they get you, having advantage
on attack rolls when there's five of them. But when there's just one, they
can't use that.  No. Anyway. Okay, um, town arrival.  Here we go. So, as
you're approaching the town, you can see smoke from fires that are, you know,
like for cooking and stuff. You can see buildings of various degrees of on
screen, various degrees of builtness, like some of them are just tents, some
of them are actual full-fledged buildings that you can see off in the
distance.  This here is a shack and as you approach, a soldier flags you down.
There's no gate. You could just walk right through and you wouldn't all you
could do is chase you.  It's not that kind of security. It's more knowing
there's somebody there to greet people and that kind of stuff. And what am my
notes on this guy?  I don't have any. I don't have to make it up. He slags you
down, Me too, right around.  Oh, I should put your guys' tokens on here. Hold
on. Yeah, small bean.  I'm not going to put you on top of each other, though.
So if we were playing online, you guys would control these tokens. Okay.  You
would each log in and you'd have a different view. And when you oops, the
visibility would work correctly if that were the case, but you'd have this
thing down here that helps you do stuff. But I do not currently have the
visibility configured correctly.  So that's fun. Yeah. Don't love that.  Um.
Yeah, see it comes in Me T. Oh, I should probably, um I don't have a. He's
just a party.  Hold on. There we go. Uh.  Hello, you, uh, here for business?
You you have traders? I trade in music.  I am a bard me trade and sing. Yeah,
folks could use some entertainment. There's.  There's only one pub or in or
whatever. Miners rest. It's in the middle.  You can't miss it. Owners's name
is Gallio. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to have someone to entertain his patrons
you are looking for something other than doing spreading some merriment's
going on.  You've got enough, sir. Take a break. We're going to the pub.
 Right, well. Don't get up to any trouble. He goes back in over there..  I'm
just a hardworking mailman with store bought buns. That was from a jack in the
box ad from a long time ago. It's some guy is a neighbor of Jack from Jack in
the Box and Jack's over at his barbecue.  And the guy is making burgers and
he's super self conscious about how he has Jack from Jack in the Box there.
Well, I don't have your fancy stuff. I'm just a hardworking mailman with store
bought buns.  But it sounds so funny out of context. Anyway. So you're rolling
through town. visibility thing is a little bit annoying.  If it were
nighttime, that's how far you'd be able to see. Oh.. If I had it configured
correctly, yes. ears..  Oh, I forgot forgot to tell you that the. town smells
like sawdust, mortar, and sea salt I think so, too, actually. It's You smell
the fires from various people's stuff around. There's blacksmiths that doing
stuff and you smell, probably smell that as you get closer.  It shouldn't
smell much because it's a hot fire. love smell.micals. And. I'm a society.
 Make your way to the middle of town. and like, "Oh, that looks like a night
no. Hold on, where's the. Which building is it?  Oh, that's not the middle of
town. Sorry. Where are we?  They're at the bottom of town. there, though. You
walk around a little bit. Yeah, you check out the scene.  Your observations
are that everybody's hard at work. There's no stress, everybody seems to be
enjoying their work. Nobody's complaining.  Sounds very nice place. So it's,
oh, the other thing you notice about it is all the buildings are new. There's
not a single old building at all.  Nothing here is more than a year old. Hold
on. Well, that's?  Yes. It was destroyed, leveled, completely leveled. I don't
think you know.  Yeah, that would be a history. And then you can also ask
around. Awesome.  Ninete? Oh, wow. In that case.  Uh, that means I have to
look it up and see what the answer is. Forgotten. Oh, when you were down at
the bottom, you saw a fountain and then it looked like a tree, but it was
actually a fountain.  Because the tool. It's the tool I use. I remember you
did say that.  The tool I used to generate this town is pretty rudimentary.
But I have the the Jason from it so I could convert it into something else if
I wanted to. Anyway, I was looking for what happened in this town because I
don't remember. go over to here.  I'm glad you Who best in the fountain? Let's
go to.. Oops..  Your first song this is about how to. Oh, this is the same
thing I was looking at.. I'm going to have to ask Quan.  Projects, Thunder
Mountain.. Where is my wallet? It's not okay.  Four. Four? Oops.  Okay,
session six planning Oh my goodness.. When I was doing this, I was so nervous
about having the whole town ready for you. So I had Claude ask me potential
questions, you guys might ask?  And there's dozens of them. 14, 15, 14 and 20,
37 questions. And another five makes 42. So yeah, 42 questions.  Magic number.
That's a good number. So, yeah, feel free to ask people questions in town.
 All right. But first, I need to find out what you know from your history
check. which I can do a search for that. you all crazy Was wasn't saying maybe
band together and built it himself. Okay, this is canonical.  This town did
have a disaster a few years ago. No. It's related to the spell plague, which
is continent wide, if not planet wide event, in which magic was working wrong
and hurting people and stuff that were they had problems.  But that ended..
And then Never Ember said, "Damn it, we need to get that town back up because
the roads between Neverwinter and Water deep are not safe enough. We need a
stop along the way, and we need guards there who patrol.  So that's the whole
point is this is going to be basically a garrison with some service to a
nearby bit of land or sea coast. There we go. There's some coast nearby that's
not like a major port or anything, but it is a place that people want to go
and fish and stuff.  So when this place is done, the economy is going to be a
combination of military fish, farming, logging, that kind of stuff Oh, yeah,
it could. It also used to be a mining town, because it's close to the
mountains, and they were mining copper, nickel, and silver. The coast is not
deep enough for big ships, so they have to anchor offshore and take dingies
in.  But not a lot of big ships come to this area anyway because they have two
bigger ports to go to. Okay, um but the answer to your so that's some history
for you because what was that, 19? That's pretty good.  Okay. Yes. So, uh,
yeah, when the smell plague hit, it was just another one of the casualties.  A
lot of the bigger cities were devastated, but still standing. Little towns
like this leveled by one thing or another, there's rumors of a wizard who was
building a tower and that went wrong. Rumors of extra planer creatures coming
through and having their way with the town. are not gonna be not.  R they like
do they not like magic users? Is that something that reveal. think about that.
How do you want to check that?  Do you want to talk to the guards more? Maybe
at the club. I go to the club?  Okay. We'll I don't want to be Or is it like
understood that it was bad? Well, it was a 100 years ago, and nobody here.  So
there's people here who are more than 100 years old, but they came from
elsewhere. There's no locals. There's no such thing as a local here.  This
town just sprung up about a year and a half ago. That's how big it's gotten in
a year and a half. There were a lot of these people from the previous 100
years.  Everybody from the previous town, if they escapes, they didn't come
back. Oh, okay. All right.  Yeah, so nobody here is going to be traumatized by
the events of 100 years ago. It's not exactly 100 years. This isn't 100 year
anniversary or anything.  It's like, give or take, 90 to 110 years. I think
the I think there was some. Now that it's been 100 years since the spell
plague, what can we do with the world that we were afraid to do before?  "Hey,
let's get Laylon back up.. I smell a bad idea. I'll have to look into.
 Actually, it would be dirt cheap because... There's nobody to like, nobody
owns it. Basically, yes, you can do that.  Yes, what because it's a newer
town. Yeah. What do you want?  which we had here? All right. Let's.  So buy.
So here, let me just show you the whole town. So is you go into the in it's
not busy, it's late in the evening and.  Oh, and you noticed that people were
working. Like, it's it's after dark, and you can't tell from how much people
are working. People are just working and working and working.  And you go in
and you meet. What's his name? Gallio proprietor. of the miner's rest, it's
your classic fantasy pub.  There's nothing unusual about it in that sense.
Stone fireplace, wooden brick construction, beams across the top, steep ish,
like roof. There's.  So the front half. Let me just go over here., Oh, yeah,
it's a two story. So the bar area is this front half on the first floor.
 There are stairs that go up, and then there's rooms up there. And then the
rest of the bottom part, there's like kitchen and office. Um And you can guess
all that just from looking at it.  It's Yeah. So, was it going on? Yes,
Gallio.  So Gallio, welcomes you. Oh, how do you do? What brings you to Lelan?
 He like ushers you to the bar., interested in maybe some land. Oh, my.
helping the buildings. Hmm, yes.  That would be much appreciated. Of course,
there are no older buildings left, but helping out with the construction would
be great. We can't get enough people fast enough.  Never Ember is as eager to
start doing business here again. We'll, of course, have tariffs at the service
fees, at the gates of the town to pay for the security on the road. As is
tradition.  But yes, there's ample opportunity here. And in the meantime, I
would like, I'm looking for work as a musician. I have openings.  Absolutely.
We have, once a week, we have a day off and everybody who has the energy to
comes here and we've never had entertainment before. That would be great..  He
says, what should I call you? I'm songbird. Oh, me?  Oh me? I'm see if. Have
we talked about how notorious or how famous you are or not?.  You know, the
first show I think there's like a local area, maybe, but not, maybe not this
area. Never heard of you. says more about me than you. I I just haven't I
don't get out.  I've been here for a year and a half, ever since the work
started and I got nothing. I got no time on my hands after watching over
everybody. Watching.  Well, you know, making sure they're fed. Oh, the town
guard, of course. And they're watched over by themselves..  Oh, it's just
Never Ember, it's just so eager to get this stuff built up, get the. Oh, I
forgot what we called it. Get the construction off in the east. taken care of.
 Block off the suspicious areas may be left over from the spell plague. This
is it. This is it.  Yep. That's. You're going to do another one?  Another end?
Is that what you' saying? Oh.  Oh, I thought I meant this is it.. Oh, no, this
is a pub and an inn. It's a public house.  You' need another inn. Most people,
most locals don't stay here. Yeah, another inn.  I'll tell you, it's, I'm full
a lot whenever any kind of merchants come through. They come through about
every other day and and money and it will come in the money, then we're gone,
can manage I' going to say that out loud? I don't..  We're not here. Could you
use a second in? Yeah, yeah, I I've had to turn people away.  So. gave us a
number it would cost to get that going and we would come up with a task split
the cop. Well, the hard part, you understand is labor. You've got to compete
with Lord Nevermber, and he's been paying very well.  This is the best work
you can get this side of the continent, which I can't remember the name of
right now. been some of the second name is good attract more. He is he
building out, more people now. Well, if you want to talk to Lord Nmber, you'd
have to get in touch with Four Woman Sarah.  She knows everything's going on
around here. She's, if you want to find her soon, she is usually up by the job
site up the mountain or up the hill. Oh, well, pleasure meeting you.  You yet?
Yeah... You' knows anything weird?  Oily? What? Are you asking?  Yeah. Oh,
yeah. There's lots of weird things going on around here.  Like what? Oh, well,
let me tell you. Well, you got to look out, too.  Watch your back. Watch your
back. Absolutely.  It's dangerous world anywhere, of course. I mean, this is
one of the safest places you can be in this area, but except for maybe
Fandalin. But.  What's that? What's Oh, well, there's bandits on the road. And
that's why we're building up this town.  And then off the road, there's
wildlife. And then in the. And then there's also been some rumors of
supernatural activities of a distinctly negative sort.  That would have been
handy. And we don't have any clerics here, either. What am I looking for?  Oh,
yeah, I'm looking for I remember what I'm looking for. for Yes, except by
where the Tower used to be. They've been digging, trying to clean out all of
the contamination and I mean, it's just nasty up there. But some of the
workers have been seeing and hearing weird things, telling stories about
whispers and shadows and. some of them say it's not that Lord never ever can't
pay them enough to this day, and they left.  I haven't seen any of it myself.
I'm just telling you what I heard. This is the tower where Sarah is in?  As a
matter of fact, it is, yes. She spends most of her time up there. It's.  There
are two priorities in this town. One is building up a town strong enough to
support act as a garrison. And the other is to get that tower site
investigated and secured. investigated?  situation. Yeah, you can probably,
well, makes money for. Yeah.  Because it's like, we're doing a job. So we need
to go to's never going to see if we can figure out his go. That's the game
plan.  All right. Beats me. Well, we got a general store, I doubt I'd have
holy water there.  Not a lot of that sort of thing around here. You know, most
of the mages are they're still researching the spell plague, of course. And I
mean, that's what they say.  I think I just, you know. Exactly. Up in their
towers.  Yeah. You know how it is. Trust them as far as I can throw them..
 Stun walking. What am I doing? Oh, yes.  Well, uh, you be careful and hope
we'll see you again soon. His name was, I have to look it up again. Gallia.
 What Galliano, but it's just Gallio. I'll? I have time right?  Oh, yeah.
That's two more days. We got to figure this out in two days. make some.  We
can do both. Oh, I forgot to watch the time and it's perfect time to take a
quick break. I need to use restroom..  All right, ghosts, what I can I do with
that? What. I can you?  attend to a reader the mind with the future. I need
anything from the kitchen. I' still got some of this left.  I guess I'm fine
for now. Let me charge, I can pause again if I need to. You You guys need
anything?  All right.. Shortest break ever. Uh, yes, so you make your way up
to meet with for Woman Sarah, whom I have notes on in here somewhere there she
is Sarah Hammerstone.  Yeah, so you purch a site. There's, um just a little
shack for like it's like an office. It's got where people go to look at the
plans to take their notes, to plan and stuff.  And you can tell who's in
charge, because she's carrying a chalkboard in chalk and telling people things
and asking people things and listening to them and she looks like she knows
what she's doing. And she is a Dwarven woman with gray streaks in her beard
and bronze rings. Scarred hands, leather apron over a chain shirt and she
means business.  And when she's done talking to the people that she was
talking to, she looks at you guys and comes out and comes through to talk with
you. Hello, I don't recognize you. Are you here to work?.  Callum? Inkeeper.
What did he say?, never.  I. He comes by sometimes. He's mostly a visionary
and finances. I execute his intentions here, directing people.  I Oh, yeah.
Well, allegedly. I haven't seen him myself.  I think these people are
superstitious. I mean, obviously, I know ghosts are real, but. What happens?
 Uh, well, I've personally seen a lot of residue of the spell plague, which.
Oh, you know, like, and then she comes out of the shack, the rest of the way,
and reaches into the ground, digs a little bit, and then comes over and shows
you. And you see here on this rock, in that little purple part right there.
 That's left over from the spell plag it. It's everywhere. It's...ation.
 Yeah, yeah, you can. I mean, it's just a rock. that you got from the ground..
That little pool.  I' go for it. What's your intention here? What are you
trying to accomplish with this?  Are you trying to impress her? I don't. Okay.
 So you're trying to impress Sarah? Let's see that's gonna be that's gonna be
I guess it's performance. Plus two for your performance is it 19 on the die or
17 on the?  Okay, so 21. She smiles. Ah, I see what you did there.  Some sort
of magic user, I'm guessing. Yes. We could use some help investigating this.
 I. I think it's all just leftover from back then, but some of the workers
swear up and down that there's something down there. Oh, down in the. We're
digging.  Oh, and she gestures off this way. The, uh. So there was there was a
wizard here who had a tower, and under the tower he had these tunnels and he
had summoned monsters to dig the tunnels for him.  And then the spell plague
happened and we don't know what happened here. We just know that there was
this from the history, we know that there was a tower here and that was Wizard
in it. And then when we finally came to look, tower's gone, but the tunnels
are still there.  So we're digging through those, looking for what was he
doing and what did he dig into to greedily, too deeply. And as I was saying,
the miners doing that digging, some of whom come back, why does a ghost
swearing, they saw or heard or felt something. I't been down there myself,
because I don't have time.  But you know, if you want to take a look. take a
look and you can let us snow and remember is available. Well, let me see. And
she turns around and goes back into the.  She says, "Come on." And as you
follow her into the office, and she pulls down some stuff, looks through a
calendar, he's going to be by, if nothing happens to bring him in about 20
days. 20 days? Yeah.  He doesn't come here very often. He's just.. Oh, he's
got business up in Neverwin.  He's a busy man. He's, you know, lord of the.
Oh, gosh, forgotten the name of.  This is Robert forgetting, not Sarah. She
knows. This is the famous stuff.  Hold on. Never. Let's just see if a internet
search.  The got Never E. Lord Protector of Never Winter, open Lord of Water
deep 15th century DR that's where we are right now actually we're and and he
is. You know, he's always rebuilding, never winter as well. They didn't go
unscathed from the. the spell plague.  Who decides what? Oh, yeah that's him.
Yeah, he tells me what he wants.  I make it happen. I tell him how much it
costs, the money shows up. I. I'm trying to get more workers.  I've got I've
got scouts in Never Winter and Water Deep. Trying to get more people to come
work, but we already tapped the job market. It's anybody left either is unable
to work or not interested?  Or they work for us and then left with a few of
those. Anyway, yeah, he's busy up Neverwinder, doing Neverwin things. I can't
find the thing.  There's like this, oh yeah, Lords of something or other that
he's one of. And I can't find it right now. But she would know.  And I can
tell you the gist of it. It's the people who are the forces of good in this
land are bound together through. I mean, they're good people, and so they can
actually form alliances and not stabage the other in the back.  That's why
they're trying to save the lands from people who do stab each other in the
back. They run the. It's not like this is a country, but it has a sort of a
military that is just the Lord's own people.  So never embers's got people,
and there's easily a dozen other lords who each have their own people and they
they have money from having been in a long line of succession of successful
nobles, making money off the land, opportunities, doing deals, that sort of
thing. I think Nevermmber may have gotten some of his wealth from taking down
bandits and organized crime, that sort of thing.. Anyway, he'll be around for
his usual monthly inspection in about 20 days.  And. Yeah., you. Yeah.  Like
private eyes. Or Ghostbusters.. Oh, that'd be so great if you could address
that.  Even if it's a hoax, if you could prove it's a hoax or solve the
problem if it's not, that would be worth a lot to me, because. I. I'm tired of
having to rotate workers in and out. Yeah, you can't take care of our prog
while we do this.  Oh, yeah, I can cover your room and board and on top of
that, I'll pay you 15 gold to take a look at the mine. It's alright, but I
expect Superior. I expect the unexpected.  Oh, you'll get that.. All right,
well. let me have somebody take you to the mines and we'll see how that goes.
And then maybe I'll have some more work for you too.  And then she goes
outside and does that thing that that whistle thing really loud. And one
person comes running over. Yeah, oh, what do you need?  Take these two into
the mine, get them suited up with hard hats and all that. And take them,
especially take them to that one spot that that one guy said that the other
guy touched the wall and stopped talking, whatever that was. Supposedly, I
don't know.  Okay, I think. I think he just didn't want to work in the mines
anymore. I was too ashamed to say it., have like a.  Oh, yeah, I do. I can
send magic. I would say right now if you're sensing magic..  You are sensing
it. You don't even have to turn that on. Right now, you would say, you can
tell where you have a feeling in your gut.  I'm right now that wall? That
wall. You mean, like a mimic?  We haven't had any mimics around here. Roll,
I'm gonna see if you actually do know what it is, because it's fairly common
in this world. Roll.  For your 16, I'm going to add, I guess that would be, I
guess that would be history. You've heard of Mimix. What they are is you so
Thunder may have seen mimics in art where it's a chest that's open and has
teeth and a tongue. like a treasure chest.  Okay. So they disguised themselves
as furniture and stuff, and then when people are, you know, not paying
attention, they attack them. So, like, if you come across a chest and it's a
mimic and open it, it'll bite your head off.  They're a classic D&D thing like
like orcs and goblins. It's that classic. Okay.  I got a question for the
tower was there, but it's not there anymore. Yeah, that's the.. That's about
all you can say about it. a red flag.  Lots of weird stuff happened back in
the spell plague. And that's true. Could absolutely be on..  I don't think
maymics have ever gotten that big. What. It's like What?  on that plane
somehowing through to this. That is a thing that you have heard of happening.
Oh.  There was planar intersection during the spell plague. I'm an planes? You
do?  That's right. The wild is another plane, I believe.? I believe so.  This
is Robert talking. I believe so. Sarah doesn't know.  She doesn't she's more
of a logistics woman than history or Arkana So yeah, so this guy takes you
over to another hut, passes you guys some hard hats. Doesn't watch to see if
you put them on right. I do.  It's too big. Runs off, assuming you're going to
follow him. then looks back to make sure you're following him. Right.  And I
don't actually have a map for this, so I'm going to. What am I going to do?
I'm going to, hey, what?  Oh, I hit the wrong key. That's why that didn't
work. I'm going to go to just go to here and just say you're up around here
somewhere maybe over yeah like at the top of that little hill there..  And
then, so yeah, you pass some signs saying active mining site be ready to
evacuate at a moment's notice. No smoking. no breaks in the mines. All kinds
of crap like that.  And it takes you in, and you guys go around this corkscrew
thing to go down. It's like, oh, how long is this? And then and then it
branches off all different ways and he takes you on one of the branches and
then you get to a rough hewn stuff where there's not beams overhead anymore.
 It's just kind of loose and he says, it's over here. And there's you can see
red in the rock, and then there's a hole, and it's been opened up enough for
people to get in. And you can see on the other side that there's a room.  Your
magic sense. Let me look at your character sheet and see what.. You have you
have detect magic as a first level spell.  You're not casting that because you
don't have to. You could if you want for more information. I do a Narck would
tell you what you're feeling.  So I would recommend that you do do that..
Three. I get three in that.  Is that right? Arkana. Yeah, you've got plus
three in Arcana.  So that's a 15, that's good.. I have to go back to here.
back into here, spook miners. Oh, okay.  So, um You haven't even gone in, and
you can see some symbols. I have to look up what this word means. I think I
know, but..  Oh, it's not what I thought. Okay. Um, you see some netetheres.
 You don't speak netheres, but it has a distinctive style. It's easy to
recognize for anybody trained in Arcana. The Yeah.  It's warnings of some
sort. Oh, yeah, I think you do. I think one of you does is it Maybe not I know
there's a spell for that.  Yeah. Oh, is that what it is?. I don't see it in
your list.  I thought so too, but I don't remember how. we were all cheating.
I think you just read the dwarven. Did you?  Yeah, it was only Dwar there you
speak dwarf people but we't. No. Yeah, I think that'.  Can I read Goblin or do
they not have writing there? They don't make a distinct. Yeah, they do have
writing.  It It's a recent development for them. All right. So would you like
to enter the room?  Yeah, why not? Um The guy that brought you down here does
not enter. And he's kind of like as far away as he can be from the hole while
still being within earshot.  Could we ask him what's? Because we haven't heard
it from. What are these people, what is his buddy seen as anyone in this room?
 What is going on? I gotta tell you, I I mean, I heard about it before I saw
it, and then when I saw it, my eyes hurt, you know? Like, I was looking at the
sun, but it was dark.  And then Jork touched one of those symbols and hadn't
said a word since. It's a guy that Sarah was talking about. Uh, you know, we
we're just minors.  We don't know about stuff. But, it's obviously created by
intelligence something or rather, because look at how smooth it is in there.
And, I just feel awful, just even being close to it.  Now, what you're
sensing, being, small bean, is that's right, I was looking at your character's
sheet to figure out how you would sense this stuff. You have where is your
features and traits? Okay that's just spellcasting stuff. keen senses.  That's
just proficiency in those things. But I'll go ahead and say. yes. You would.
 It feels like the sound of Bagpip's badly played, except you feel it as an
itching and coldness in your bones. Ew. And it's as you get closer to the
room.  I would say, actually, you probably feel it too, because the miners
feel it. And it isn't changing. It's just there.  We can't. You can't see it.
I'll go ahead and tell you now.  It's not ionizing radiation, so you don't
have to worry about cancer. Is this coming from the room It's coming from
vicinity of the room. You can't really tell exactly where it's coming from.
 It might be the whole room. Then you said net, it's written in Nethere.
Netheres.  The net were a people an underground people, or my notes on that
girl, you would know without rolling that you would have heard that they kind
of died out or disappeared by about 100 and something years ago before the
spell plague or maybe right around the spell plague. Maybe there's a
coincidence there. Maybe it's connected.  They're underground people like a
magic. I'm actually reading this page now to see It's a lot of weird words in
here. They're not that well known so unless you've studied something proximate
to them, just that they exist at all is about all know What the heck?  There's
a lot in here. Yeah, they they disappeared and and only people who are experts
in not paleontology. Anthropology know much about them.  It kind of
disappeared into obscurity. But they were magic users. Their society was
revolved around magic that much you would know.  And there's ruins in there of
their script that you don't speak, but you can tell it's theirs because it is
notoriously different. It has things about it that just like we can recognize
Far Eastern scripts as being Far Eastern, even if we can't tell if it's
Vietnamese Japanese Mandarin or whatever It's like that. Or we can tell that
it's Middle Eastern, even if we can't tell if it's Fars Sea or whatever.  And
so what you have now is you have confirmation that there is something that you
as competent magical people can confirm is, as the miners say, not right.
Ain't Tate natural.. And what skill would that be?  I don't know if there is a
skill for that. Maybe just a raw intelligence check. Yeah, just give me a
couple of intelligence checks.  I'm done. Well, this time, you're just not
thinking about it. You're not focused on the thing I'm gonna tell you.  Shout
out to the two crew. Yeah. a ad and something? Yeah, add your intelligence
bonus. bring up.  Six altogether? Okay, well. You're curious with that reddish
streak in the rock is, but nothing comes to.  Let's see. You guys only get
high rolls when it matters.'s hilarious. magic, right? We can see command it
to like bright and Command?  It's not. Not in that sense. No, it's more like,
um..  The comparison to ionizing radiation is kind of reasonable. It's it's an
invisible field of mystery. And What would you do about that?  Did you already
roll me in Nar Connor roll? You did, didn't you? What was it?  All right, go
ahead and roll another Arconnor roll, 13. Is that with your pussy? Okay.  You
got a 20? Okay. The earlier mention of planar stuff, when you were talking
about the tower going into another plane, this has the signs of it gives you,
it reminds you of something about the planar intersection things that had to
do with the spell plague that parts of the world intersected with parts of
other universes and where that happened, things could go back and forth.  And
it's you could infer from the context that this room was constructed around a
rift of that nature with sigils indicating that that's what was going on and
that there was risk of crossing over to the other side or something else
crossing over. So there is now a hole in the universe not far from you. And
the feeling you're feeling is the, you know, the fingernails on a chalkboard
of two universes grinding against each other.  That's what you're feeling. The
reverberations. For some reason, resonance is going to be a recurring theme in
this arc.'s.  Here's our. Everyone gets. code with no one's going on, not the
other. I'm trying to think if they would volunteer some information.  Just a
moment. Sure. Yeah.  I coffee. There's rocks. You're in a mine.  You can just
grab and you'll. Oh, I see what happens? Oh, that's.  Go ahead. We're throw a
rock? Um, Half of the rock hits the other side of the room, and the other half
disappears.  Because it'sing and so. It went through the fault, and part of it
went one way and part went the other. It's really hard to think in four
dimensions, not including time, I got to say..  If they're not very careful
about it, if they're as dumb as a rock, definitely. I take another. Okay..
 Oh, we want to try to map it out? Yeah. down there and just throwing a rock
into the other how big this is. down there a while. Killing.  I don't know
about them two. They was just down there throwing rocks and laughing. I don't
get it.  Are we in the room or not yet? It sounds like you're not. I thought
you were going to go in, but then you were talking to this guy, so I figured
you couldn't be in there because you were talking to this guy and there's no
way he's going.  No, we can safely go in. There's like an opening, like the
size of this screen, and you can see through and you can. The room appears to
be a 20 foot cube..  So a 20 by 20 floor and a 20 foot ceiling. Do you have
any stakes or long objects in your mind? Maybe a hole of mining acts, like a
pick ax or something.  They wouldn't leave one behind. Well, no, they're tidy
here because Never Ember pays them well enough to be tidy. throwing a rock it
out by sticking it through if pull it back. Yeah.  Because if you can't, you
can't bring it back. That's smart. I never use it.  Okay, you want to poke it
with your spear? Yeah, we want to map out how big the hole is and where it is
in the room. So then and also to see if we can even bring it back.  I should
have come up with this in advance. covering You guys are smart enough to know
that if there were a difference in. You know about equilibrium and. Shit, why
can't I think of the word?  Chaos. I was going to say, what do you call the
everything deteriorates into?. Opposite of order, but not chaos..  Yeah, it's
the he death of the universe stuff. Yeah, I I remember at our mother's wake or
whatever you call it, that your mom said something about it. Yeah.  Well,
anyway, um physics- wise, you know that if, for example, there were water on
the other side and it were under pressure compared to here, it would come
squirting through. So, because you saw that the rock went through no problems,
so there's nothing impeding the rocks, you. You can guess that it's air and
air on each side.  You know it's air on this side. You think it's probably air
on the other side, otherwise there would be a breeze or something. Yeah.  It's
the air over there were different from the air over here, then they would
cross over both directions because that equalization of stuff.. That's some of
the least well-explained stuff. But let's go ahead and have you poke it with
your stick.  Let me think about what that does. I'll have you. All I'm gonna
have you Still figuring out what this does.  I like magic to make sense, so
I'm trying to. And this is something I've thought about before. the idea of.
Oh my.  We're not ready. Here's what I'll tell you. As you start to reach your
spear in, you begin to see distortion. that you hadn't noticed before, that in
the far wall, there's roomes, and they kind of like that and then like fade
out and in without actually disappearing exactly.  It's like, it doesn't make
sense. You think maybe you see stuff going by, but you don't, like you can't
tell what it is or if it's like right there or if it was off in the distance.
But you get a feeling for this room is perfectly built around at the 10 feet
in, 10 feet up, is the center of this phenomenon, and it extends out like,
maybe seven feet radius or something.  And. And you realiz as you're looking
at this that the stone, it's the arc of its trajectory, was right along the
edge of this spherical sort of space. And you might suspect smart people, you
think maybe that the reason that sheared in half had to do with it going like
this instead of like that.  Like going orthogal to it or normal to it. If you
cross the boundary along a normal vector, then you're probably safe, and if
it's tangent vector, that's dangerous. Interesting.  Yes. And when you retract
your spear, when you retract your spear on the tip, it's warm. Your spear is
warmer than because you're in the caves and it's kind of cool down here.
because you're not far enough down for the heat and pressure to a thing.  It
is warmer and smells of sulfur. Ew. that smell. That's what I can tell you.y
hell.  Such a thing does exist, and you know this to be true. There is a hell
and there's a sort of a heaven and there are demons and there are angels, but
they're not. There's no single all encompassing God.  There are many gods of
different tiers. It's kind of like the Greek pantheon. And they are real and
they do like show up and make commandments and stuff, not very often, but it
has happened.  It is known to be a thing that can happen. Um. And let me see,
would you know about...  No, I don't think you guys would know about that. So.
Maybe.  From, like Exactly. Exactly.. Or you could like build a ramp in like
Stargate. that's what we just go in or in then.  Probably. You might need..
You might need, like, magical armor or something like that.  Who knows? But
maybe it's fine. Um.  I think that's going to have to be the cliffhanger,
because I can't think of a better one. That's a really good cliffhanger. Yeah,
you just poked tail, maybe.  Oh, my God.? I just What the hell? I supposed to
buy?  I don't want to go back to in our town. Yeah. I' take a nap.  You know
what? Let's go talk to the elevator. Let's keep it light.  Wait, let's go back
to Change our mind, you mind. I want to go back. Just hotel.  Just want again
and go on two adventures in small me, and now I'm working That's crazy. You
don't have to die to go to hell. Let's just go by wolf.  We didn't. Maybe you
should have. If you'd find all of it would be like 20 minutes later now and
there would be.  It'd be 532. No, I would have taken more than 20 minutes, I
think. All right. you find the.  So you stick your spear in hell. W what the
other side, just a little sphere going in and out. Could we bring the
marshmallow, put it on the tip of the sphere and it's a lot of things.  You
can, hey, it's your mom." I' your mom. Hey, what's going on?  What's Hi, you.
Okay, well, if you need to talk to Thunder or Kyle, they're still here, too.
I'm at home, but they came to my place for game this week.  Oh, we moved it to
Thursday because Kyle's schedule changed. No, it's just the end. I just did
the cliffhanger.  You're timing was perfect. We're in hell.. Okay, so what
what's your Well, yeah, what's your question?  I still want to do a little bit
of wrap up with these two. Um. I don't know, like 10 or 15 minutes?  All
right, tell me your question and I'll figure out if I can answer it quickly. I
am the worst person to ask that. There's no way I would know that.  But let me
see if I can think of who you could ask that of., None of my friends would
know that... Yeah, what? You know?  Oh, that's a good idea. Yes, do that.
Bye.'s so crazy. find out about.  Where are we strategy is? Good. Good..
 Good, good. Um, for that for not going in there. It's, gonna do it.  Nope. It
wasn't gonna be right now. retires to Water deep. Takes a new name. name.
 Never heard of this facility. I don't know what you're talking about.
Mountain, but vandalin.  No idea. memory. Spotless mind. Eternal sunshine, the
spotless mind style.  Let's see now. Yes. So what do you guys think about
meeting here?  Is this good? Yeah. Yeah.  I' fine. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I
love not having to, compete with the dogs for. the exact. Nice. And I think
next time I'm going to try this the screen by the window and I'll sit over
there and you guys can sit over here and stuff..  Wait, what was that noise?
Oh, right. It was me logging in over here.  Whoops. Okay, I can look at that
later. Um, this is recording.  Um. Did I miss anything? I don't think so.
 Yeah? Yeah. That was good.  That was fun. Yeah, I actually went a little
better than some of my previous sessions. I'm pretty happy with that.  I'm
getting better at the note preparation part a little bit. I need to review
Claude's out part more carefully. I guess I don't have anything else.  I love
leftover pizza. It's the best kind. It's the only kind of leftovers I like.
 Well, and dessert, of course.. Is this breadsticks? Oh, well you can have the
wings then.  I'll do wings. Um.. Yeah, all right, well, next Thursday. 3
o'clock.  That was? Yeah. Oh, I'm so glad.  How are you? Yeah..'s. Good, good.
 That's that means that you're invested. Yeah? Yeah, we ended about an hour
and change early.  That's That's a good. I don't know how you talk. Right.
 Well, I broke my own rule. I was complaining about Claude escalating the
story too fast, and then I escalate the story. Like, you've already got a
potentially world ending secret base.  Yeah. And now you may have breached
hell. Maybe..  Al level. Oh, you're five, aren't you? No. on.  If you're not
level five yet, then, okay, well,. Yeah, go ahead and be level five. Yes.  The
nice thing about level five is I think you'll get an extra attack and you'll
get something else awesome. I can't remember what. Maybe it's only fighters
that get an extra tech.  I don't know. Level five is a big step from four.
You'll get. tiny Oh, those are so good.  Yeah, I don't want one of those. I've
used used that in Scott's game to great effect. It was super, super handy.
 It. It It's a really cool little idea the way that it's described. It's.
 Yeah, I don't remember exactly.. It's something to do with, like, you can see
out, but people can't see in. You can see it.  Yeah, that's so great. So
great... All right. too.  Good work. Next Thursday. I don't know what I'm
going to do next week. gosh.  Jesus. I got, oh, I guess I should ask you what
you're thinking about doing next, but you don't have to tell me now. Just let
me know in your text text me in the group text what you guys want to do about
this.  You a chance when you don't go into. That's fine, too. That's totally
fine.  We got 20. Never Eber. It't too far away that wear what we need to go
in theplane.  We could have magic. It's just a day away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 It's like tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only a day.  Oh, well. All right. back.
