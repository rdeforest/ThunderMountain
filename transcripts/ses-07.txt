[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   That's okay.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Well, it's okay with you, maybe.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   But, Claudia had a heck of a time figuring out what was going on.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Just hearing me.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   But, we got it.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   We got it all figured out.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's not even three yet.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   You're early.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   You are.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Good job.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Oh.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Surprise!
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Oh, now we can have pizza.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I've been nervous all day about getting this set up just right.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   That's ridiculous.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It seems perfect.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Awesome.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:31.200]   I didn't clean up the cat crap on the floor.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   It's dried up, so who cares.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   It's not actual crap anymore.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   Oh, that.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   Whatever.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   Cat's gonna cat.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   I'm still figuring out how to make the map show up over there.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.560]   And we've got, oh yeah, food, let's eat.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.560]   Oh.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   We should get another folding table, quick, quick, quick, here.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560]   Here's our flats.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   Blew together.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   That's his tradition, about making two.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560]   That's okay.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560]   Good as two.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   I show it straight away.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:16.960]   Do you want to stay a little bit longer, Tom?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.800]   I want to be straight.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.360]   Sounds so bad when you do it, Lola.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   Got you ice cream.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   Oh, thank you.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360]   21.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   That will augment my coffee, don't it?
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   Yeah, kids.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   You need peppers or corn?
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:58.960]   How do I associate this, oh, I bet it's down here.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:11.560]   Oh, this is a setup.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:33.680]   I'm going to try to make something really dramatic come up so that I can use this thing
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   this time.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   Oh, God.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   Well, hell came up.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   No promises.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   Well.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   That was pretty fun.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   and it smelled sulfurous and a little warmer. Whether that's hell or not, there could be a lot of places that do that. Or what part of hell. That's the other thing. You know there are nine hells in this room?
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   I don't know. Like purgatory-ish kind of? Oh my god. Yeah, it's a little bit based on what's his name, Dante. Based on Dante's Inferno. That's not fun. Each hell level has its own ruler and stuff. I listen to podcasts. It's given Dante. Exactly. That's exactly what it is. They're pulled from everything that was available. There's probably Santa Claus in here somewhere.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   I was listening to a Let's Play podcast once where they made one of the demons be the demon of all the hells, and so they started calling it the one hell instead of the nine hells.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   Oh, if you noticed this. Sorry. I should have said something. I just forgot. I wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't pointed it out. Really? Because it seems very noticeable. I'm not very good at noticing things. That's fair. I thought my lip filler dissolved. It's not exciting. What's lip filler? Like fake lip.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   I didn't know you had fake lip. I don't know. That's because I did a good job. I didn't know that either. It did. We're looking very late in the story. That's true. Yeah. But I thought it dissolved because it was like five years old. Okay. Yeah.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Anyways. Now you can't give any lip. Yeah. I'm going to go back to a thin lip. It looks like you've been eating blueberries out of one side of your mouth.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   This would be my favorite. I might have to change it up. Yeah. There's a round table in UTC. Do they look good? I think we're too far away.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   But in general, I think they're comfortable. I think it's the sauce. I like the sauce. The bread is good too. Yeah. And I like that they cook it a little more. Yeah.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   Round table.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   How do I say who created this?
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   Place members? Yeah. Did you pick your skulls last time? I think so. I thought we did it when we got married.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   We usually do.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   Yes. That's probably important. How do I add?
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   Oh yeah. I think you want to do the one that I can understand languages and you do the one that you can read. Oh, right. That's right.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   Good call. Yeah.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   I'm happy to tell you I figured out what that chamber is. It was just something Claude made up and I had to roll with it. But now I figured it out.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   You can't do it. It's been a science in the background.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   Right now I don't know what will happen. There's stuff in there.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   Ooh, my deception and intimidation for real. You got level five? Mm-hmm.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   You guys are level five now. Big time.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   I'm not going to be handing waffles out like candy anymore. I know I say that every time, but this time I mean it. Anybody want to eat it?
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   I just want to do a great actor.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   Hold her. I don't care about that.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   This is not going to create a...
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   Okay, that's...
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   How do I make...
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   Oh, configure ownership. What is this? Oh, that has configure ownership. All players observe her.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   Oh man, that works. Or should. Okay, let's delete this piece of crap.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:37.680]   What was your other new spell?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   Do you have that scrying spell? There we go.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   We're in midair. We're actually...
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   We walked through a launch in a fall.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   Is there a ground?
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   The thing is, I guess if you stuck something halfway through...
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Oh, I thought I did a cantrip mage hand.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   Why?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   Mage hand is great. Why? Oh my goodness. Remote control of switches and levers and things, dials, super handy, especially in your current situation.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   Oh, shit. There you go. Yeah, just send that hand through. Go on hand. See if it comes back.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   Do you have anything that gives you sight somewhere else?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   Like a pair of eyes.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   Wait, I got a bunch of things that I didn't realize. What? I can fly? You touch a willing creature for the duration the target gains a fly speed of 60 feet and can hover.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   Okay, you can fly. Or make somebody else fly. This is Claude's fault, you know what it is. That's my story, I'm sticking to it.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   You can understand Carl, right? What are you saying, Carl?
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   Give him a flight thing and send him through and have him come back.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   I have a really good idea.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   If I tie to a string, let's tie a rope around Carl and send him through.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.680]   Okay, that's a good idea.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   Or you can go find a bird and I can eat it.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   I love you and your bird.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.680]   Birds are bad, especially the coordinates.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   So I can fly and I can shape ship and I can understand my vision.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Oh, you can just turn into a bird then, right?
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   Yeah, I guess. I don't know if it gives me the ability to...
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:18.680]   Oh wait, no. So aquatic adaptation, I can breathe underwater and swim.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   Alter self.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   Oh, just none of the statistics change.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   I couldn't turn into a dragon because I'm too small.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   You could make yourself into a little dragon-like thing but you still wouldn't be able to fly.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   But could you cast the fly spell on you?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.680]   That you could do, unless they're both concentration.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   Let's find out.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   One of them is, alter self is, fly is also concentration.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   However, if you get, there's an item, a canonical item that you can get, type of item, to concentrate on something for you.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   So that you can have two concentration spells at the same time, which is extremely powerful.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   What spell is, what spells are the shape shift and...
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   Alter self and fly.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   Okay, you've got good stuff in here.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   And I can do a misty step so I can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   That is also extremely handy. I've used it many times.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   Wow.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   You guys haven't played Valor State, right?
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   I haven't, no.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   Well, I want you to know that the stuff that you're doing is related to the story in that game.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   It wasn't my intention, it just worked out that way.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   Yeah, it was bad then.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   But it was my intention to have it be in the same role so that once you played it in somebody else's game and they had that play in that role, you'd be familiar with some of it.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   So these first, second, third level spells, if it's like a big thing that we're going up against, I'd want to use a third level spell?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   Yeah, you've only got the two slots, but yeah.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   And it's not necessarily going to be some kind of aggressor or something.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   If there's a situation, you need to get yourself out of it, then yeah.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   It probably depends on the situation.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   But Fly, absolutely. If you started falling, I think it only takes one action to cast it, so as long as you don't land in six seconds, then you can cast Fly on yourself and hover.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   That's cool.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Do you also cast it on Carl, send him through, tie it to a rope, and then bring him back and then ask him what's over there?
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   I have rope in my backpack.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   And I can do a, I wonder if you can, can you cast, because if you throw an object through, you could essentially cast something into it too, right?
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   Because I can cast that hut thing, that way when we go there, we're not immediately ambushed because we're essentially invisible behind, like opaque sort of thing.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   Give us a little hunting tent to look around.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   Our tent is at, I think it's 10 feet square, so it's not, it's not small.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.680]   They're like over there in this room, maybe.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   It would fit in this room, except for the room for the bird.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   Or you just like cave in the whole thing and never go back again.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   This isn't home now.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   Go back to the forge and like just lock it in.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:18:02.680]   Now, I didn't do any preparation for if you guys decide to start your own hand, but if you do decide to, I won't start the, or if it's a session, I'll just keep figuring it out later.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   I don't know if we have time.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   I mean, depends on what your priorities are, right?
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   Well, I think we said in order to do that, well, you need labor, labor and capital, and the guy isn't coming for like 20 days or something like that.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   That's what she told you.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   And so if we help this person out, maybe, maybe we'll be in some good graces for the inn.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   I'll tell you that for nothing, you're absolutely right. So, right, like we're kind of doing quests for, we talked about it, like we just want to do quests for people to make money in.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   People come to us at the inn and be like, hey, we need help with this.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   Oh yeah, we had a whole idea of like in the back room of the inn is like our side business where people come and give us hard quests and we do that for money.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   I love that.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   I try to make a point of keeping track of notoriety.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   So you've gained already a little bit of notoriety for from the miner that brought you there from you guys not having as much of a reaction to the whatever the fields are that it's giving off as the rest of the miners.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   So you guys are kind of looking like badasses, which is fair because fourth or fifth level is like peasants are never even a whole level, they're half level.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   The miners are probably first level.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   And the levels probably don't seem like as much as they are because I've given them out too easily.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   But when taking into account that a fifth level fighter gets hit twice in a round instead of once, it's kind of a big deal.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Is that just that's not to sell like to fight?
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   Yeah, and that's just a fighter thing.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   It's built into the fighter class and your guys' classes will have something else that happens.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   Every class has a fifth level. Oh, my, sort of thing. Let's see, you guys have that small beans character sheet right here.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   Just go to this thing and at fifth level, you've got sorcerous restoration, which when you finish your short rest, you can regain expended sorcery points, but no more than a number equal to half your sorcerer level rounded down.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   It's kind of cheap. But anyway, once you use this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   So before a long rest, one time you can get at your current level two boxes of, wait, no more number equal to half your expended sorcery points.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   Oh, it's sorcery points, not, that's not the same thing as, you know what, I haven't played a sorcerer, so I don't actually know.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   Yeah, I certainly don't know what it is.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   Just so happens I have a book over here.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   Player's Handbook, PHB, that's what they call it.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   Are you done with it?
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Hell no, I shouldn't. It's good.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   It's pretty good.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   Let's see. Where are sorcerers?
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   Classes, Sorcerer 138.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   Spellcasting. Is there a project to ask a blogger to explain to me?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   Is that the guitar?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   That is, what, the Gary guitar? No.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   So that one is a guitar I got in Mexico. That one I got in Seattle and that's just special because it's a 12-string.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.680]   Yeah, looks like the Gary guitar.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   The Gary guitar is back with Martha.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   Oh, really?
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   Thankfully, because I was afraid I was going to have it stolen or damaged or something. I was going to feel awful.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   Fair enough.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   It's the Gary guitar.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   It's the Gary guitar. It's a really nice guitar and more importantly, it was Gary's.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   I wish I had gotten it again. It sounded awesome.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   One time I had a dream that I met him and like actually met him and talked to him and then my mom was, I don't know, it was like zone three or four.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   Because kids are weird, you know? I feel like they can like...
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   Absolutely.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   I don't know. Anyways.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   I had a dream about my mom dying three days before she died.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   Yeah, on Wednesday I woke up, called Martha and said, "Is her mother okay?" And she said, "No news."
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   And then three days later she called and said, "Get on the plane if you want to see your mom again."
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   Where?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.680]   Yeah, like I guess the dream itself, it wasn't her. It was like a dog, but it was dying of cancer.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   It resembled her.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   In some way. It was like some part of me knew something had changed.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.680]   I also had a premonition. Well, maybe it's not pre. I had a munition.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   I had a dream about a fairy crashing into a dock as it was coming in.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   And then I went to work and in the news a fairy had capsized off the coast of Africa and over a thousand people had died.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   Oh my gosh.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   Yeah, the Jula. J-O-O-L-A.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   That's...
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   And V. Jula. Yeah, they got in a lot of trouble for that one because it was way over... it was almost 2,000 people. It was way over full.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   I think there were 64 survivors or something. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   And it was under maintained and it shouldn't have been out in the rough seas and like there was thing after thing of what they'd done wrong.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   And it's classic green stupidity.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   That sucks.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   Anyway, sorcery points. Converting spell slots to sorcery points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of sorcery points.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   Okay.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   What is a sorcery point?
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   You're supposed to know that.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   I don't.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   It says in your app.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   Yeah, and I don't understand it.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   I'm going to ask Plot to explain it to me so that I can explain it to you.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   I did when I read it, but I haven't since.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   That's cool.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   I like that.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   I'm going to fill me in.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   Sorcery points are the sorcerer's unique resource that gives them flexibility with their spell casting.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   Think of them as a secondary currency alongside spell slots.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   Here's how they work. What they do. Sorcery points fuel your metamagic options, special abilities that let you modify spells as you cast them.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   For example, you might use metamagic to cast a spell as a bonus action, extend its range, or affect additional targets.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   So that's huge because casting a spell as a bonus action means you can cast more than one spell in the same round.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   How many do you get?
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   You start with the number of sorcery points equal to your sorcerer level and they recharge on the long run.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   Converting between resources. This is the clever part.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   You can convert spell slots into sorcery points and vice versa.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   That's weird.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   Turn a spell slot into sorcery points. The slot level equals the points gained.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   Okay, so you could take your two third level spell slots and turn them into six sorcery points if you wanted.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   I don't know why, but anyway.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   This conversion system gives sorcerers remarkable flexibility that your previous classes didn't have.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   I totally thought of what I had played before.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   Running low on spell slots but have sorcery points left? Convert them.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   Need more metamagic fuel? Convert it.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   Let's see.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   You know fewer spells, but you have this dynamic management thing. That's the trade-off from wizards.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Wizards are, as I understand it, the most complicated class in the entire game.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   Is that what I am?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   No, you're a sorcerer. That's different.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Sorcerers get their magic from study. Sorcerers get their magic from themselves.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   Like their skills or whatever.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   Like it's inherited or something.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   Paladins and clerics get theirs from a god or goddess who is their patron.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   Says, "Okay, do my bidding and I'll give you these spells. You've been doing a good job. We'll give you more spells."
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   And then there's another kind of spellcaster that I've forgotten, but it doesn't matter.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   I might also be mixing up Pathfinder with D&D.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   Are you looking at your actions?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   The innate sorcery, undersorcer features.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   So, like Robert was saying, you have five sorcery points.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   You can use the Faunt of Magic. Essentially, you're converting two of those points for a level one spell.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   So if you used up all your level one spells but you haven't used your sorcery points, you can use two to get it back.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:01.680]   More importantly, you can do it for three for a level two spell and five for a level three.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   So if we get into like an "oh shit" moment, you cast all your level three spells, you can use your five unused sorcery points to gain one more.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   One more level three spell back.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   And then you could also do it vice versa. You can get rid of spell slots to get sorcery points back, which I guess the only time you'd probably do that is for the Meta Magic.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   You have, I think it's basically two things that you would normally be using.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   So if you're not transferring it one to the other, you can basically kind of change your spell.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   So, careful spell. You spend one point to choose two creatures to automatically succeed on a saving throw.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   And it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a success.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   And then the other one, which you might use, because I think you used it before actually, the Transmuted spell.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   You could use it a lot.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   So yeah, you could use one sorcery point to change the damage type. So if there's a monster that you do a certain spell, it does a certain type of damage, but we know that they're more susceptible to another one.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   Yeah, so then you can change it.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   Oh, but I have to spend a sorcery point?
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   Yeah, but you haven't done that more than five times in any session.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   So really if we do whatever D20 roll for like Investigation or Arcana, whatever to see what the enemy's weaknesses are, you could be doing that prior to every spell.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   Alright, I get it.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   That way it's like a more damaging, like a tailored attack to our enemy.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   Yeah. I get that. Okay.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   That is a lot.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   If you guys wonder, the easiest is probably the fighter.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   Because then it's an attack.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   It is an attack. You get more stuff with each level, but it's pretty simple. There's no magic.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.680]   They added more magic-like abilities, I think they call it.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   But it's yeah, it's a lot simpler.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   Alright.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   Yeah, okay.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   Alright, I'm going to go ahead and start even though it's nine minutes early. That's fine.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   Everybody's ready.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   Since Seraphina's not with you, there's no Professor Brightwater or Brightletter updates.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   Ah, right.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   But the news for you guys is last time you left Phandalin, you had to lay along to find out what impact your activities have on the preceding day.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   In a half, two days I think you guys spent a night.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   It was like two days.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   You spent a night in the facility, so what your activities from the previous two days have done to the rest of the world.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   Along the way you encountered some very unfortunate wolves who were not prepared for the monster you made yourselves into and tore ass out of there.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   There was nothing left but a dust cloud behind them.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   It was very limiting to them.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Well done also.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   That kind of thing. That's how you keep getting levels every session.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   You just keep blowing my mind.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:40.680]   And then you got to lay along and you found that it's a bustling town that's still busy becoming itself.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   You met a guard where the road met the edge of town and talked to the guard about what was going on,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   about how the place is getting rebuilt on Never Ember's orders and on his bankroll.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   You got directions around.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   I need to bring it all the way up. Thanks.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   Oh thank goodness I have this over here.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   Yay!
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   You met Galeo Alibro at the inn and started thinking this inn business was interesting,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   that there's only the one inn in town and there's probably 1,500 people here.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   And it's a busy road. In fact, part of the reason that Never Ember is rebuilding it is for security.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   The high road between Neverwinter and Deepwater? No, the other town.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   It used to be busier with commerce and now because of the bandits,
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   only more protected goods go up and down the coast.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   And Never Ember wants to set up patrols on the road, start incarcerating bandits,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   prosecuting them, because he's lawful good so he doesn't do the whole string them up thing.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   And he's known to be. He's one of the council of lords or something who are all law-abiding.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:31.680]   They drink the Kool-Aid of goodness. They're not just being kind to their neighbors.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   They're demanding that everybody be kind to each other or else.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   That's where the lawful part comes in, drink the jail.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Yes, but you'll be well cared for in that jail, whereas a lawful evil jail is a very unpleasant place.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   Guantanamo.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   Yeah, Guantanamo is exactly lawful evil. Absolutely. That's a really good example.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   Separating immigrants from their children is lawful evil activity.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   Or possibly chaotic evil, I'm not sure.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   Oh no.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   Depends on the details. All right.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   Galio, Galio, I should figure out how his name is pronounced.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   G-Man.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   G-Man, G-E short for his initials.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   Told you about Sarah Hammerstone who was running the dig up where the tower used to be.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.680]   The tower being the, there was a wizard here a hundred years ago who was doing who knows what.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   And they were digging up the site to see what he was doing, whether there was anything they could recover out of it.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   Whether there was a danger there.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   Just doing their due diligence to make sure that whatever was going on.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   Hey, how fun is this?
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:48.680]   Just realized my power's not powering right now.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   Oh, you know why?
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Because it wasn't turned on.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   Did you know these things have switches on them?
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   It does.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.680]   Okay, well that was fun.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   Anyway, so yes, they're for the sake of the town, which is its primary purpose is just to make the high road safer.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.680]   And also to make money off of making the high road safer.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   These things have to be sustainable, it's not charity.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   For that they're digging up where the ruins are.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   And in the process they found this chamber.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   And Sarah doesn't know it's a chamber, she just knows that the miners freak out about this something.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   And she asks you guys to see what they're talking about.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   She said she paid fifteen gold just to go there and come back and tell her what happened.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   I thought I haggled twenty.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   Oh, did you?
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.680]   Ten each.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   You know, I think you're right.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   Yep.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.680]   I think you're right.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   That's, yeah.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.680]   It's a thousand dollars.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   Good job.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   We don't come cheap.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   Yes.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Make note, Claude, it was twenty gold, not fifteen.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   All being the haggler.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   And you know why Claude didn't know that was because he couldn't hear you on the audio.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   That's fair.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   All right.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.680]   So yeah, you followed a miner into the caves, the mines.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   And he led you to a hole in the wall that led into a twenty by twenty by twenty chamber of very dark stone with a shiny surface.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   I didn't give you all these details before.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   With sigils around in netherese.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.680]   And I'll give you a knowledge check for that in a minute.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   And a disturbance in the air and he wisely threw a rock and half the rock hit the other side of the room.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   They made a walk through.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.680]   Well, it's a good thing you didn't throw yourselves through.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   That would have been a game over.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   Well, I think you would have made it.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   Yeah, because we found out we have to go perpendicular into it, not tan and gentle.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   That's why it split.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   At least in its current state.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   There may be more to it because you've had a few minutes to sniff your javelin.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   We're going to go ahead and start the session here.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   You've had a few minutes to sniff your javelin and feel that it's a little warmer.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   And you've got suspicions about what's on the other side.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   But there's more to this than all that.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   In that the hole in the wall, the miner tells you it's a little bit, it seems like it's maybe healed itself a little.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   It used to be rougher and now it's a little bit smoother.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   You don't see anything moving, but it might be self-healing in some very slow sense.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.540]   The sigils, as you look at them more closely, you can see that they're not static.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.640]   They change.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   A little bit like, you know those LED signs that go vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   a little bit like, you know those LED signs that go (mimics LED lights going off)
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   only instead of that it's just (mimics LED lights going off)
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   saying different things in Nethereese.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   Let's do Arcana roles or history if you're better at history.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   Did you know this next to you?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   Ah, shit.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   Alright, well you're still citizens of the country.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   You know that Netherees existed, or sorry, the Nether people, Netherees people?
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   Twelve.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   Twelve, all together?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.640]   All together, twelve.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   Okay, that's good.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   Ten altogether.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   Ten altogether's also good.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   Yeah, so the Netherees were people who had, they had flying cities and they fell out of
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   the sky about 1400 years ago, or more, more than 1400 years ago.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   Before DR0, they're ancient, ancient, they're like your Romans.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   And there did continue to be some that survived the fall of the Empire, but the last of them,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   as far as anybody knows, disappeared around 400 years ago.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   This looks, this thing looks like it's functional.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   Whatever it is, it looks like it works.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   There's no sign of damage on the inside.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   It does seem to be doing something, it's not just a stone room.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   There is, on the floor, a nine foot radius circle, so an eighteen foot diameter circle
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   in the floor with like, it's carved into the stone and in like dashed lines, sort of an
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   inside/outside demarcation.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   The disturbance in the room, you would guess, is contained within that circle.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   The four corners of the room, well you can only see two of them because you haven't stuck
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   your head in, which is probably good.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   The two corners that you can see look the same.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.640]   They have things about them that are different from the rest of the wall, and they're
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   duplicated on each corner.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   So if we're standing at one corner, the left side of the wall would look one way and the
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.640]   right side of the wall would look another way, but if you were at the other corner,
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   it would look exactly the same, left wall, right wall.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   Yes, okay, and alright, what do you guys want to try next?
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   Let's do some puzzle.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   Do you want to try to do like some stuff to figure out what it is more, or do you report
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   back to the lady and just let her know?
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   I liked your rope idea.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   Kind of like, we don't really know what we're even reporting yet.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   Yeah, what's there to report?
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   So let's explore this room a little bit.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   Like, maybe to see...
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   Is that what you're thinking?
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   You want to do that or something safer?
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   I don't want you to lose your bit.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   Well, because we know if we go perpendicular to this board.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   From what little information you have, you know that when you threw the stone at a tangent,
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   it got cut in half, and when you stuck the javelin in, other than getting heated up a
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   little bit stinky, it didn't seem to be hurt, like you can see there's no marks on it where
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   it went through.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   Is there, you said it appears as if it's working, so it's not malfunctioning like the crystal
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   stuff in the forge, so it's working.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   We need to know how it works.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   Is there a skill we can roll to see if we can figure out how it works?
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   Yes.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   So I'm going to call that, I'm going to call that investigation, and if you guys want to...
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   29.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   So...
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   Somewhat of an expert on the floor.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   After pulling a Sherlock Holmes and not even actually going in very far, you discover that
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   all four corners have the same thing that I described.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   Since you've spent more time with it, you notice that the phenomenon is not static, it's
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   like warbling things.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Like it pulses?
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Not that rhythmic, but yes.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   Or rather, if it has a rhythm, you can't tell.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   Either it's a very low frequency or it's a very high frequency, who knows.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   But it's more likely that it's a bunch of different frequencies all operating at the
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   same time, so it seems random.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   Looks like noise.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:23.640]   But yeah, it's unpredictable, and you know that like on an AM radio, well you might not,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   you guys are young.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640]   I do know that.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   On AM radios, when they're tuned off of a station, it'll kind of come and go.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Yeah, like that.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   Like you can faintly hear it.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   Yeah, you can hear it off, off, off, and then it depends on what the ionosphere is doing
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   and things like that, you can get stuff from way far away, so on.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   So it's got a little bit of that mixture of something regular plus background noise, but
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   the noise is winning.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   You can also, with a freaking 29, what was it on the die?
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   20.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   Oh, it's a nat 20, you gotta call those.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   Oh, nat 20.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   Nat 20 is special, that means you get everything that I can possibly give you.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   Oh yeah, so my investigation's plus 9, so yeah, nat 20 plus 9.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   I thought maybe you had like 14 investigations for some reason.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   Oh no, sorry.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   I haven't been keeping track at all.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   Nat 20.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   Yeah, yeah, the nat 20, that trumps a 29.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   That's true.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   Now what?
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   How do we safely work this?
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   So, with your brilliance, you infer from the context that these four corners are operating
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   stations of some sort.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   And whether they all need to be operated at the same time or not, maybe, maybe not, but
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   you can see where a person with fingers on the thumb would put their hands on the two
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   walls.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   You can see where they...
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   A place where that would be.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   You remember in...
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   Oh, you probably haven't seen...
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Don't recall Schwarzenegger puts his hand in an alien handprint thing and it activates
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   the Martian something or other.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   Turns Mars green again.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   Makes Mars gray again.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   This is a little bit like that, but it's just, it's not like an indent in the wall or anything.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   It's just like an outline or something where you're like, oh yeah, there's a faint outline
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   here and all four corners have it.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   That's interesting.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   And the thumbs are on the inside.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   It's like you could stand here and put it in like that.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.640]   You also see a lot of writing.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   Do either of you have the ability to read writing you don't know?
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   Yes.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.640]   Level five, she just got it.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   Okay.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   Well, go ahead and cast that and I'll tell you everything else.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   I did not expect you guys to solve this in seven minutes.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   You know, this keeps happening and it's driving me nuts.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   It's because of that 20.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   Well, yeah, the 20 just like, this was supposed to be a half hour of gameplay.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   After the last session, I was like, we should learn netherese.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   And so I got the speaking spell and then she got the writing spell.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   Go ahead and mark off that you cast the spell.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   I can just understand it, but I can't speak it.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   That's all I need.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   I'm trying to find it.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   Yeah, I need to read the exact thing so I get it right.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   You said you just got it.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   So that'd be third level.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   No?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   I think it's...
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   Oh, it must not be in your spell list.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   It must be from somewhere else.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   Let's see.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   I actually...
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   Comprehend.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   Oh, it's a first level.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   Oh, it's first level.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   Okay.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   Well, comprehend languages.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   That sounds familiar.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   I've had that before.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   There it is.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   Okay.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   Okay.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   For an hour, you understand the literal meaning of any language that you hear or see signed.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   on which the words are written.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   It takes about one minute to read one page.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   That's silly.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   You can get in there and go touch it.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   Wait, but I have my Mage Hand.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   That wouldn't count.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.640]   Because then the Mage Hand would be the one comprehending and you couldn't tell it.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   And it doesn't have the ability to cast spells anyway.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   That comes later.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   It actually will be able to do things like that.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   I think Mage Hand can eventually help you cast spells.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   If it has a somatic component, I think at level 8 or something, so level 16.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   Level 15 Wizard or Sorcerer, I don't remember which, can use a Mage Hand to help cast if
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   they're like down or something.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   Could it be one of the hands on one of the walls?
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   I mean, you could try, but it's only one hand.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   I was curious about magic stuff, too, because if I have my mirror images, could I have them
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   or is it not?
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   Let me tell you what Mage Hand says.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   Mage Hand says, "A spectral floating hand, floating, that's important, appears at a point
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   you choose within range.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   The hand lasts for the duration, which is a minute.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast a spell
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   again.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   door or container, store or retrieve an item from an open container or pour the contents
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   out of a file.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   As a magic action on your later turns, you can control the hand thus again.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.640]   As part of that action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet."
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   How can you, oh, one minute, that's 10 turns, that's how.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   "The hand cannot attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds."
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   So, I'm, Nat 20 on investigation.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   So, I'm imagining it like this.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.640]   I'm imagining a songbird.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   Can I touch the walls without blowing it up?
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   Yeah, let's try.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   But we just don't run into the thing.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   I imagine a songbird kind of poking his hand around, looking.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   Do you have like a glass or something that you can magnify stuff with?
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   I don't remember.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   If you do, that would be good flavor.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   Don't.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   If you don't, put it in there because I want you to have that.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   Okay.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Say that you've got offer glasses, something like that.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   Where are they?
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   Oh.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   Yeah, like two or three times magnification glasses just to be able to reprint from far away.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   So, you use those and you listen and smell and look and you're not touching anything because you know better.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   You're very cautious.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   But yeah, you're able to see the similarities and differences.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   You see that there's no difference between the four corners other than where they are.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   You can see in the, where they hacked away at the wall, the marks that, how do I put this?
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   The pick marks that are starting to smooth over.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   And they opened this up like a few weeks ago, I think.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   It's like humans.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   And, but yeah, so you see that there's language and you see that the language is changing every minute or so, something like that.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   And you can direct Small Bean to use her.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   Can I change into a fly, please?
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   Alter self to change into a fly and then go touch the letters.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   I need to read that.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   I don't think so, but I want to give you a good reason if so.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   I just want to follow the options, specs last for the duration.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.640]   Okay, so...
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   Well, of a different size.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   I'll just be a giant fly.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   Yeah. You would become an old bird. What's his name? Dr. Ian Malcolm. Jeff Goldblum.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   There we go. Yeah, because he was in the fly.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   But, you can continue to poke things with sticks and throw rocks in there and stuff like that and see if things do anything.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.640]   You can try touching the wall that's next to you if you want.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Or you can do some more investigation of those things, but I don't think I'm done telling you stuff yet.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:42.640]   The investigation will reveal that there are diagrams and warnings, but it doesn't look like it's written for other people.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   It looks like it's written for the people who would be there on purpose who made it.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   And you would say this is definitely made. It's too perfectly shaped and geometric to be otherwise.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   Oh, and come to think of it, there'd be more shapes than just the circle on the floor.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   There's going to be lots of symmetry and straight lines and circles, like crop circles, but not so artistic. More engineered.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   Are there circles in front of where you put your hands?
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   That's how you recognize the hands thing. Does it look like a path, like the design on the floor?
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Oh, it looks like if there were going to be a guardrail, it would be there.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   So there's like a foot of room between the circle and the nearest part of the wall, and around the corner there's more space because that's how geometry works.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   I'd say you could walk around the circle and then whatever's in the circle, when people do whatever on the wall, then you get shot at, I bet.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   I shouldn't have put the square side on here, but we'll say that these are five foot axes. And there's like a hole in the wall over here or something, and the circle goes like something like that.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   I think this is all correct.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   That's what I had in my room.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   And then each of these has a place for somebody to stand.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   And that's the other thing you figure out. Oh, these are things where you go like this, and then something happens.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   And then you'll find out more when you read the writing.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   Yeah, so that's the situation, geniuses you. I think there's anything else you would get from your investigation. I think that's it.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   Not until I read the thing.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   Alright, let's do it.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   Alright, so you're going to crawl through the hole there?
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   Okay.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   And then you'll cross along the wall? I don't think it's difficult for you to avoid the phenomenon. You can easily get in there and look at the corner that's nearby.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.640]   And you cast your spell and you have an hour to read as much as you want.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   The things that are changing are status messages.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   They're reporting that the tuning is off. Destination is unstable.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   They're warning not to interact with the portal.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   They're saying that the console is locked.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   And what else would they say? Oh, and then the writing that's static is saying that this hand thing is how you unlock it.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   And it takes three people to unlock it.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   The four stations are identical. I'm going to say you guys are super smart. You figure out on your own that there's four because it's possible that something could go wrong in the room that makes one of them inaccessible.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   And they need to be able to unlock it if something's wrong. So they made it so you only need three at a time to unlock it.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   Would you know what the lock is from reading this stuff?
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   What?
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   You're very convincing. I'm thinking about the world.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:41.640]   What would they?
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   I need to look at one of the notes.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   Where's Greg when you need him?
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   Yeah, we need a sign hobbit to follow us around.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   A hobbit? Yeah.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   Greg was small. Yeah, that's true.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   I just like that all their attacks miss.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   It's like three in a row.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   That great. These are buddy. He's a tank. He's crazy. He's our pal now.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   All right.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   Yeah, maybe. What's funny is we're going to try really hard to figure out how to open it and then it's going to be horrible that we open it.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   And since you went in, when you got closer, you could sort of see what the destination looks like.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.640]   Oh, yeah, that's kind of cool. You couldn't see before because you were too far away.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   And because of the distortion and stuff, but it's kind of coming and going and radio style.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:11.640]   But it is a hellscape, but it's completely barren. There's no landmarks at all.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   It's just red sand, red sky. You can barely tell the two apart.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   It's just the sky is a little bit lighter than the sand and the sand kind of has a little bit of weightiness to it.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   It looks incredibly unpleasant. As you're closer, you can kind of barely smell the sulfurousness coming through.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   But just because it looks barren doesn't mean it is. Is there enough of a difference between the hellscapes that if we had a skill rule to tell from that what hellscape it is?
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   Or is there not enough from that? I don't know.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   Give me a... It's obviously a different plane, right?
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.640]   Yeah, I'm just curious because there are nine hells. Well, which one? That's true.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   I'm going to say if you get an 18 on an Arcana roll... Oh, I got a nat 20. I got a 19. Oh my god.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:40.640]   I'll have to inspect that die later. That's crazy. Oh man. What the heck? I'm going to bring this to Vegas.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   This is why they don't let people bring anything nice. Excuse me, can I use this? I don't have to ask you how you know so much about hell.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   Just for the flavor. No, yeah. I put it in my background. Did you really? Look at this guy go. What the heck? I'm going to bring up your sheet. Who are you?
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   So my... I thought I wrote it in here. But essentially, my mom was a... Oh, my poor mother was a maiden for a noble family. She wanted a better life for me, so she switched me with a royal family.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:45.640]   Oh yeah. So you're saying it's part of your education under your fake parents. Yeah, but I think she was like into the magic stuff because that's where my magic stuff comes from because my original mom before she died was like into some magic stuff.
[00:59:45.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   Okay. All right. Well, then you know quite a bit about the nine hells. And what you can see is, what you can gather from this is, it's one of the top ones, but it's really, really far from anything.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   It would take maybe days to get anywhere near the edge of where the hell actually starts being, where there's demons and condemned and things like that. It's the outskirts of it.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   Is it on like a different plane or is it something that... The hells are on a different plane. Okay. So it's the outskirts of it. Are each hell on a different plane? No, I think they're all on the hell plane, I think. Hold on. And it's just kind of like a pit? Is it like a con? It depends on your taste. It's kind of like asking what the United States is like. I mean, you could say, well, it's big. Yeah. It's different everywhere you go. That's what hell's like.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   So you can't walk from one hell to the next. It's all inner planes.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   There's ways between them, yeah. It's not exactly portals, but more like gateways. Yeah, something like that. But this is the outskirts of one specific hell. It's the outskirts of the hells. It's like so far out. Each of the nine hells is ruled by a demon. None of the demons will claim this place. They don't want it. They don't care. It's dead.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   I guess what I'm asking is if we go through it here, is it connected to just one hell, or can you access all the hells? Yeah. Okay. This is like the outskirts of all the hells. Yeah, of that plane. Yep. Yeah.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:54.640]   Like the Sahara desert. Start it in. In hell? There's not one there. I guarantee you. Oh my god. What if we go through the demons? It's been done. It's not impossible.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   Well, demons are like lawyers in a lot of ways. I believe they're lawful evil. Is that why you call it? Lawful evil? Yeah, so as long as you know the law as well as they do. Like a mob boss. Yes, exactly like a mob boss. Yes.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   I can get behind that. I support it. They tend to have some kind of motive like making people do stuff they don't want to do or something like that. But as long as you can work with that, then they don't feel a requirement to make everybody suffer.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   That's like some demons maybe, but not all of them. Demons are as different as people. As anybody. That's one of the recurring themes in my games is there's diversity in everything. You can't take anything for granted. Just because somebody's got horns doesn't mean they're good or bad.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   Okay, well, so Nat20 on the history of hell. What else can I tell you about this?
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   You would say nobody's been there, the part that you're looking at. It's never been. It's like, so the earth compared to the worlds of D&D is actually pretty small.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   The planes that are not infinite, but they can go on long enough that just nobody's been there. It's like the Sahara and then Sun. Just there's no way of knowing, but it's pretty good that nobody's ever been there.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:51.640]   That's what you're looking at. Also, you know it's not a good idea to go there, because in mechanical terms you'd be doing constitution checks every minute. So every ten rounds.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:04:09.640]   Is that because we can't survive? Yeah, because of the heat and the air. The air is somewhat toxic. The heat is bad. It's over body temperature, so you cannot cool down. It's like the desert out in Arizona.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   But you also know from reading the sigils and things that it is detuned from a destination. It was pointed somewhere and it's not pointed there anymore.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   And you can tell between the two of you that, freaking geniuses, that every time I do the prep for a game, I think there's no way they're going to figure this out. And then it's like five minutes. Oh yeah, it's like this.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   That's the role. So sometimes it's the role. Sometimes it's like, oh yeah, I've got a spell for that. Other times it's like, well, she'll just stand on my shoulders and go ooo. And I'm like, I've got a role for it.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:25.640]   It might have been pointed at that location that it's pointed at now, but more perfectly. And when it is pointed correctly, the phenomenon might be a little different, just like audio sounds different when you tune it off. But something could come.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   If there were anything over there, yeah.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:37.640]   So if we fix it, is it going to lock in at some demon's house?
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:57.640]   Yes, the handprint things have zero of three displaying as the indicator. So status locked, zero of three authorizers. That's it.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   Would you get the last clue?
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:14.640]   With your Nat 20 on investigation and your ability to read it all, I'm just going to tell you, it's an alignment check. You have to find three neutral good people to do this.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   Oh, they have to be neutral good?
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.640]   Yeah, according to the system. It has to deem them neutral good based on its ability to evaluate that.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   Is she neutral good?
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   Yes, she is, actually. But she's also now more than a day away. She's already a day towards Waterkeep. That's what I started remembering the name of. Waterkeep is the one down south. But there's 1,500 people in this town.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   How do you tell that? You just have to ask them. That's something in the world that they just know.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   I don't like the alignment stuff. I don't like for it to be a mechanical thing. I prefer it to be a story thing. So I don't think people in the world use the nine spot thing. I think they just talk about whatever they are. They have politics or whatever.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   But the symbols translate in your mind because it tells you the literal meaning. Translates in your mind, too. You've got to find three neutral good people to unlock this for you.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   I didn't even look up what, I didn't think about what your guys' alignments were going to be.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   Chaotic neutral.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   Chaotic good?
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   Chaotic neutral. Yeah, you guys have no chance of opening this thing up.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   No.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   Unless you change your alignments. Just doing neutral good things.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   Yeah, that'd be me.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   Yeah, it might take too long.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   So, can we switch to my homeowner here? Let's see, whatever. Homeowner, yes.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   Light.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   Oh, did I grab light?
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   Sorry.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   It says light. It doesn't taste like light.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   It has a light, but is it different?
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.640]   I can't tell. No, no, no. I'm not going to have that.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   But thank you. I'm going to make myself another coffee.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   That would be the only one there.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   It's okay because truthfully, this was meant for me anyways.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   It is totally fine.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   I'm going to talk while I make coffee, I think.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   Oh, sorry.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   That's crazy.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   Because of your investigation and reading, you have a lot more to tell Sarah on the surface.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   You can tell her exactly.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   Sarah, you dumb bitch. They were right.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   It's not good in there.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   Close this down and rally an army.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   You know that you can change the destination.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   See, that's cool.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:25.640]   And you also know that it's currently locked out unless they find somebody who knows what you know or speaks Netherese or has the spell that you have.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   We're kind of gatekeeping it because no one around probably speaks Netherese.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   No, it's an ancient language.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   No, but you could read it.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   I can understand, but no one's speaking it to me.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   I thought you could speak it. You have speech.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   If I'm talking to someone that is, if someone is saying it, then I can understand it.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   Yours is written, mine is spoken.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   Mine's written and heard.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   Yeah, hers does both things.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   Mine is speaking.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   Oh, then I could speak to someone who is speaking it.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   So like if I met a Netherese person, then we can communicate.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   That is correct.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   But does this mean I can communicate with Carl?
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   Does Carl speak Netherese?
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   No, just whatever he speaks, right?
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   Because he speaks what, Dwarven?
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640]   Uh, yeah.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.640]   And like that bee-boo-bop, bee-boo-bop robot.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   Well, I'm just saying because I don't have it now, but one of the other spells that I was going to get and I didn't was message.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   And I can communicate through planes, the different planes, if I know the person.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   And so if we sent, if I have that and we sent Carl through, I can talk to Carl through the plane and ask him what's going on over there.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   But I mean, we already know, it's like a barren hill.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.640]   Plus, is Carl still like healing?
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   No, it was the other robot that was healing.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   Oh, cause Carl was pretty banged up too, I thought.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   Oh, that's right. Cause he was just like slumped over.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   Don't you have a mending spell? I thought you did them.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   I think so.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   Yeah, I think you did. Or you would have done a mending spell on him.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   I think he's all better now. I think if you'd said that he was messed up, you could have fixed him on the forge.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   Should upgrade him with lasers.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   Laser cats.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   Sharks with freaking lasers.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   Laser cats, yeah.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   Laser cats!
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   I love that. That sounded a lot, right?
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.640]   We're going to have lasers at the wedding.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   We are.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   Because of course.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   Actually, we have a Pink Floyd laser show.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   Could we get someone to do a laser?
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   Have you seen...
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   Oh, I've done research.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   Have you seen the drone flight displays that they have? There's a company that'll do them, like make dragons be in the air and stuff.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   Or have them do a drone thing over the court murder mobile unit. Or have them do like alien stuff so people freak out and call the cops.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   Alien drone.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   Oh, that's a lot.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   Now we have our own portal.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   Yeah, we've got a portal.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   And a magical forge. We're like...
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   Are we God?
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   We're only level five.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   If someone asks you if you're a God, say yes. Check out the little thing I got.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   That looks fantastic. That's a good port.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   I'm so pleased with my setup over here.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   What kind of beans do you use?
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   What kind of beans do you use?
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   These are some I got from the Prouds, but this is from the...
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   Oh, I like those.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   Yes.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   And then I was getting some from Seattle, but I stopped that subscription because I was planning on cutting back on my coffee and then I...
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640]   Then that didn't happen.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   Didn't happen, so I'll probably start that subscription at the end and see.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   Or maybe I'll just keep getting local coffee.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.640]   Yeah, well the Bird Rock Coffee USD Engineering is working with their coffee lab.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   No.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   They look cool, all the little coffee and stuff in there.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   So in the engineering building, there's now a coffee lab.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   I love that company so much, the Bird Rock Coffee Roasters.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   Martha and I would go to the One-On-Marina every week to meet up while you guys were still living over here.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.640]   Yeah, I remember.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   Well, I guess you weren't, but...
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   No, you were. You were living over here. That's right, because we went to USD together.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   And yeah, and they still recognize me, that guy with curly hair, tall guy.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   He's a dad now.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   Oh.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   Just...
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   Yeah, lots of people there recognize me. It's great.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   I love that.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   I do too.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   Alright, so, is there anything...
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   I guess I should let you guys ask questions rather than me volunteering and stuff like that.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   Is there anything else you want to know?
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   I have a question.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   Yes.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   Because I'm pretty sure there was like a little cave worker who went mute because he was so stooped by something.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   That's true.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   And that's because he touched the wall or something. What was that for?
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   You can't trust everything here. You weren't there when it happened.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   Maybe he touched the wall, maybe somebody caught him jerking off. No one knows.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.640]   Okay.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   Maybe he just doesn't want to talk about it. Maybe he's using some excuse to get out of work. Who knows?
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   But that was... there was a rumor that somebody... something happened they couldn't... not necessarily couldn't. They wouldn't talk anymore.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   Gotcha.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   It might have gotten better by now. Who knows?
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   Sarah didn't know who... which of her workers it was. She's got a pretty big operation.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   She's got people under her who manage the individuals.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   There's like... maybe a hundred people working on that site.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   Because it's like... it's like the scale of a small office building being built. Like a ten storey building.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   That's the kind of operation you're looking at there.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   And then in the town is where the rest of the stuff's going on.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:07.640]   Where they're putting up more housing, paving the roads.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   That kind of stuff. Maybe partitioning different areas for selling land.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   Alright. Well we went down there to help Sarah out with something.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   Yeah. She just wanted to know what's down there. And you now know.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   Oh, actually you know that it was built on purpose for the goal of... because you can read all this stuff.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   Yeah. With the goal of experimenting with a stable portal to other planes.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   I have a question. So you said that because it's off and if we... if it's not aligned, if we...
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   Oh, misaligned. Yes.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:16:00.640]   Would we know from our investigation that if we aligned it, would it be another... it would be another place?
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   But could it be on a different plane other than the Hell plane?
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   Yeah. 100%.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   You get the impression that it's able to... or it is meant to be able to reach anywhere there is...
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.640]   anywhere in the multiverse. Period.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   Like even us here playing this game right now, in theory...
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   They could come right here.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   Yeah. I won't do that in my game because I don't like getting tipped and chasing and stuff.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.640]   But that's the idea.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   I'm really somber.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   All of a sudden.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   Would we know from those roles or would we have to later figure out if we aligned it, how to aim it at places we need?
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   You're going to have to figure that out.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   Okay.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.640]   Yeah. You don't know the controls yet. You haven't even seen the controls. You don't know what they look like.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.640]   All you know is this and the displays.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.640]   Are they in that room, we think?
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   Yeah. They're definitely in that room. You know that the three corners or the four corners become consoles that any one of which can be used after they're all unlocked.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   The thing is we need different people. We can't even really...
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   You also have to decide what you're going to tell people about it because you don't have to tell them the truth.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   Yeah. I don't really want to tell people.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   You're not intro good. You don't have to tell them anything.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   Because we would need three people to keep it quiet and then trust them.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   We need to go find some trustworthy people is what we need to do.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   We need a little guild.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   You're going to find a guild?
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   What's a guild?
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   Kind of like our little clan, little group.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   You have everything you need to find a guild. You've already had some adventurers. You're highly competent, capable.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.640]   Is brick neutral good?
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   I don't have to roll for that.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   Because I'm not brick bad.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   Normally goblins are supposed to be evil, but the card mods are an exception to that.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   He's either neutral or good.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   Is he chaotic, neutral or lawful?
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   I'm going to say if on a five or lower he's chaotic.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.640]   On a 16 or higher he's lawful.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   Otherwise he's neutral.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   So 6 to 15 is neutral.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.640]   He's neutral.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   Nice.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   Now is he neutral or good?
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   I guess he could still be evil.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   I'm going to keep this to myself.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.640]   No you guys have to know.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   But you'll find out at the end I suppose.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   What are the odds?
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   Actually you know what?
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.640]   I don't have to roll for it.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   Well you don't have to roll for what he actually is.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.640]   But you can find out without meeting him.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.640]   Because you've met him and talked to him. You've had enough experience.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   You can just do a...
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   He's a good lord.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   What's the word?
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   He's a good lord.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   You can do an insight check based on your past experiences.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Insight.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   11.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.640]   He is currently, or as I said the last time we saw him, true neutral.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640]   He's not good, he's not bad.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   I can see that.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   He just wants to see.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   He's still too young to really feel strongly about how he interacts with the world.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   I can see that. Alright Greg, you're off the hook.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   You said it earlier, but maybe I forgot it.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   Neverembert, was he...
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   He's good, but he's lawful good.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   Lawful good.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   He sent a message to Seraphina?
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   Is she neutral good?
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640]   She is neutral good.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   And you would know that from having spent so much time with her.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   She absolutely helps people for no reason, and also doesn't interfere for no reason.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   What about the professor?
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   The professor, I think is chaotic neutral.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   He's ridiculous.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   He's kind of a lush too.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   That's part of where the chaos comes from.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   His middle name is Attabar, and that was a joke I made up for because he's the guy you find at a bar.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   There's guy Jack at a bar. And then I gave him a real last name to hide that part because it was a little bit too silly.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:49.640]   I'm looking at my list of questions that the machine asks people who touch it.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   Well, it's not really... It doesn't ask them, it just...
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   Anyway, yes, what's next?
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   Any more experiments? You want to head outside?
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   I think we literally know everything we can know.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   So we know...
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   The line is still nearby if you want to ask him anything.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.640]   Because he's going to take you back outside.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   Well, right now what we know is it is something that with the right people and unlocking mechanism...
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   It's an out of service portal.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   And dangerous in its current state.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   And you also know that the difficulties that the miners have been having is because it's detuned.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:36.640]   You can feel the detuning too, but you guys are stronger stuff.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   What does that mean?
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:50.640]   You're getting psychic damage, well you're not getting damage, but they're taking psychic damage from reality being torn at by this disconnect.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   It's like there's an impedance mismatch and it's causing heat.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   It's not thermal heat, it's psychic heat.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   So we do need to tune it.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   That would be great.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   Or if we want to figure out how to shut it down.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   Or you can shut it down.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   I would say let's tune it, but no we can't have a bunch of people down there.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   So we gotta go tell Sarah the...
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   What's the rest of her name?
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.640]   Hammer? Storm Hammer?
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   That sounds right. Hammerstone.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   Hammerstone.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   We gotta tell her something.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   People shouldn't go down there until we fix it and then maybe start the journey to fixing it.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   Do we tell her what it is?
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.640]   No.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.640]   At some point someone should.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   Don't ask questions or we'll...
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.640]   It's dangerous.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   Either the cave will kill you or we don't go in there.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   It's a hidden toxin.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.640]   Are you lying?
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.640]   Or are you just telling her it's dangerous?
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Will she settle for it's dangerous or is she gonna be like...
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   Are you ready to find out?
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   Yeah, let's go. Let's get out of here.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   I can't tell you that.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   You have to ask her.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   Do you want to talk to the miner for anything?
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640]   But we are in agreement that's the plan?
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   No, I'll just be like yep, it's weird down here.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   We're gonna tune it eventually, but first we need to make sure people don't go there.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   The miner is as far away from you as he can be and still be available to you to reach out to.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   He's like not trying to listen in or anything at all.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   He wants nothing to do with this stuff.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   Let's go talk to her and tell her to keep people out.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   You know what we should do is tell the miner like it's a miracle any of you are even alive.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   And then like word spreads and no one even wants to go down here.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   But to tune it we would need...
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.640]   That's kind of true in a way actually.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:47.640]   They could have had fake alleys in there if they had run in there or something.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:52.640]   Do we know how to tune it?
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.640]   No.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   But do we know where to figure that out?
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.640]   Is it by going in the room?
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.640]   There's a good chance if you go in the room and unlock it and the consoles do whatever they do
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   you'll be able to figure it out.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.640]   But we need the three people to unlock it.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   So we gotta go.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640]   So that's the mission.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   Okay.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   Let's get out of here.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.640]   We gotta get out of here.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   This is us deciding anything.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   It's the same thing.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   So funny.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   We should do a D&D to plan our wedding.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   Hopefully your wedding.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   What do you want to do?
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   Wait, we'll just roll for it.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640]   Roll for it.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   Roll for flowers.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   We'd go into our wedding planning meetings and we'd bring our little dice.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   We could do the big stuff on that.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   This roll is important.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.640]   Like what we eat.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   You save your wedding planner.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.640]   Hold on a sec.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.640]   Chicken or fish?
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   Fish.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   It's beef.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   Alright, yeah.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   Let's go talk to Hammer Time.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   And I'm just gonna tell this miner, like you gotta let everyone else know, like you're not
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.640]   crazy.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   This place is awful.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.640]   So you come back to the miner and he's like, "What are you doing here?"
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.640]   So you come back to the miner and he's like, "Oh, what do you think?"
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   It's terrible.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640]   You gotta go immediately.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   I knew it.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640]   Don't ever come back.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   Everybody out.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640]   Exactly.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   I knew it.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640]   I can't believe you've been down here ever.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   I should make him roll for the inside check.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   It's a really high bar.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   Let me see here.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   He's probably at ten.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   He's got a roll of...
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640]   What's your guy's?
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   It's a closed check.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:41.400]   Whichever one of you is talking, you're gonna roll words.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.520]   You're gonna roll deception.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520]   Deception!
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520]   That's me.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.520]   Okay.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520]   I've been rolling like shit.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:59.800]   Well, I don't know what to say about that.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800]   Seven plus five, which is twelve.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.800]   That's twelve.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.800]   So...
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800]   Not good, Bob.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   Wait, can I borrow your inspiration?
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   He's gonna miss.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   He's gonna miss.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   That was pretty close.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   He rolled fifteen, but he's plus zero, and I'm giving him a circumstance penalty for...
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.800]   He's engaged.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   He was already scared.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   He wants to believe you.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:23.400]   That'd be weird for him to be like, "I don't believe you that there's something dangerous,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.380]   even though I already believe you that there's something dangerous."
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.380]   He rolled really, really high.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.380]   How did he roll fifteen?
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.380]   Is that bad of a liar?
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:40.240]   Well, part of the bowling thing is, is there a chance of a mess-up?
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.280]   So one of the rules of GMing is, don't have players roll for something that doesn't have
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.280]   a reason to matter.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.440]   And in this case, I wanted there to be a possibility that he wouldn't be convinced, because I think
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:58.120]   it would be interesting if word got out that you guys were misleading people.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:06.560]   But, since you weren't exactly misleading him, and since he wanted to believe you anyway,
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.800]   I think fifteen's my highest render roll, and you didn't roll low enough to really blow
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   it.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.260]   If you would roll like a two on the die, I'd have to project a monster down the way and
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.840]   then to scare him out of here.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   All right.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.840]   So he's like, "Well, let's get out of here.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   Geez.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.840]   Ah."
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840]   And he's like, barely letting you guys keep...
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.840]   I guess you guys are quick.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   He hurries you out, and he starts yelling down the hallways, "Everybody out."
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]   Yeah, get out.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:36.920]   Scram.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.920]   Birdman's coming.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.920]   Yes.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.280]   And then a little later, you make it up to the top.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.520]   Nothing has changed topside.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   It's still...
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   I guess it's early.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   It's like midday, maybe?
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:54.520]   I think you guys came to the town right after sleeping, or was it late at night?
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520]   I forget.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   It was late at night, wasn't it?
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   It was in the evening.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   He decided not to sleep, because you were so close, I think.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   True.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.000]   So it's still nighttime, and they do stuff 24/7.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   So yeah.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.520]   So there's like magic lights shining on the work site, people working, carrying things
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.080]   around, and this little guy is running around, being like, "Oh my God, ah!"
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:29.480]   And he's saying whatever the safe word is for the line, "Bananas, bananas!"
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   And everybody's like, "Oh shit, bananas."
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   Oh my God.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   And they're like, "A banana or a bunch?
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.480]   A bunch of bananas!"
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.480]   Shit.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   They're manifesting giant bananas.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.480]   In pajamas.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.480]   They're coming down the stairs.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.480]   They're coming up the stairs.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:49.600]   He brings you back to Sarah, and then he runs off into town.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.560]   He just can't handle this right now, he wants to be at this level.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.640]   So Sarah, what is going on?
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.140]   What did you see?
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:11.760]   We saw enough to tell you that you shouldn't have anyone put down there ever again.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:19.000]   Just say something, like there's some sort of magical disturbance that is dangerous until
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   it gets fixed.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.360]   It's turning your people cuckoo for cuckoo puffs.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.040]   So keep people out of there until...
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.880]   It's giving lobotomies to people.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.560]   Until we can fix it.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.440]   But then, are they going to want to just, once we align it, are they just going to want
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.800]   to send people down to mine it after that?
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   Because we're going to have to explain something later too.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   Don't say we're going to fix it.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.800]   It can't be fixed.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   You got a board mission.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800]   Go mine somewhere else.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   You can't fix it.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   I'm lying.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800]   I'm chaotic and neutral.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800]   I knew it.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.800]   I'm what?
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.800]   But then they're going to see us sneaking in there like at night to try to...
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   Will they?
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.800]   We're telling them evacuate.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800]   Evacuate.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.800]   Pick up camp.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   Go somewhere else.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800]   This isn't it.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   Well, maybe when we talk to Ned, remember we can tell him the truth.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]   But not her.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.800]   We're telling her.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.800]   Feller, it's closed.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.800]   Don't go in there.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   Okay.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.800]   That's what we decided.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   Shit's whack.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   Something along the lines of that.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   So what are you saying?
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   Shit's whack.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   Can't go in.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   At all?
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.800]   It's dangerous.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.800]   No.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   It's going to give...
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.800]   What's the risk?
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.800]   What can happen?
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800]   A brain scramble.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.800]   Your people are going to die.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:33.800]   I don't want that on my record.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   Magical sickness.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   And you're going to...
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   Exactly.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   And it's permanent.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   All right.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   She does her thing, signals to her top people, get everybody out, cordon off the area, and
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.920]   then she says, "Is there anything we can do about it?"
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.920]   No.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:56.920]   Nothing.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.160]   Like how bad is it?
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   It's bad.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160]   So bad.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.160]   If you mine it, people will die.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.160]   It's a miracle no one has died yet.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.160]   That would have been blood on your hands.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:23.800]   I've got to say, I never remember a note.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800]   Yeah, that's what we want.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.800]   She says, "I guess I've got to pay you guys."
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800]   Home is urgent.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.800]   Yeah, give me my 10.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:28.800]   So she reaches for her purse.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.800]   20 total.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   10 each.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.400]   And is her disposition there?
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   She gives you 20.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.680]   Can I just try a hand and take everything in her purse?
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   Try.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.680]   I'm just kidding.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   Okay.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.680]   That would be her perception versus your slight hand.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.680]   Do you want to try it?
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.680]   Yeah, try it.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.680]   Is that your...
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   Is that small mean smile?
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.680]   Do it.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.680]   You only have plus one and slight of hand.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:02.640]   Do it to someone who's not our boss from the bottom.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   That's why I said just kidding.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   Do it to some thief or something.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.640]   Are you doing it?
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.640]   No, I'm not doing it.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   I'm just kidding.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.640]   Because I'll help you.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.640]   I just don't want to.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.640]   She's trying to get us Never Ember or whatever it is.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   Sure.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.640]   Here we go.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:32.680]   All right, well, here's your coin.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:39.160]   I've got to write to the infirmary, and then she doesn't kick you out, but she just sort
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.760]   of turns around and ignores you as she goes to her desk and gets out supplies to send
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   you a message.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   Hey, don't forget to tell him about us.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760]   Does he know you?
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:47.760]   No, but we've requested his presence.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.760]   Oh, that's right.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   For a business offer from you in a lifetime.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:50.760]   Does it get you kind of a skeptical eye because of the way you say it?
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   All right, I'll message you.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760]   I guess it's going to take two sentences.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   For a loan down payment of 3.99 gold.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760]   Is there anything else you needed?
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   No.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:18.240]   Are you going to be at the inn downtown?
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.240]   Yeah, we'll be at the inn.
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.240]   All right.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240]   It's a good place to look for people we need.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240]   Exactly.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.240]   Yeah, we'll be at the inn.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:28.320]   Now that everybody at this site has been kicked out, there's going to be lots of people at
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.800]   the inn being like, "Oh, I don't even need to do it right now."
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.840]   We should find the three people who are like, "I don't understand why we have to leave.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.240]   It wasn't that bad."
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.240]   They don't know.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:46.560]   Once you get them down there, they're going to be doing constitution saves to see if they
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.720]   take psychic damage or wisdom saves.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.720]   I guess it'll be wisdom, not constitution.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:51.720]   That's right.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:52.720]   Wisdom.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.880]   You're going to be asking them, "We need to bring you somewhere we're not telling you
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   where and we'll give you that gold."
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.880]   We're going to have a PTSD.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.880]   Don't ask questions.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   And then they throw up.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   While you're like 30 feet away.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   This feels like the mind.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   All right.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   Okay.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   So you're making your way back to the inn.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   I'm making my way back to the inn.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.880]   So you stomp down the hill.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.880]   I would like to really pull you down the hill.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:24.960]   Bumble Bumble, Pell Mellon, Pull it Pull it.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.960]   Oh, she likes the pokey little puppy?
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960]   I had that book when I was a kid.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.960]   I loved it.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.960]   I think Blitz has my copy.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.960]   I think she's sending it back when she gets a chance.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.960]   Oh.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   She asked for my address because I gave her a whole bunch of books.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.960]   Kids books?
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.960]   Because she had a library.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   Anyway.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:43.960]   She said they're moving again.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.960]   Did you know that?
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:46.960]   Unbelievable.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.960]   Why can't they find a place?
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   Wait, what do you mean again?
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.960]   Like from the place they just moved to?
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   Well, I mean, oh, did they just move?
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   Like from Utah?
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   So they went from Utah to, what, Colorado or something?
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.960]   I don't know where they are.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:54.960]   Something.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   Something like that.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   They're moving again like in a bit.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.960]   I don't get it.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:58.960]   Those griffins.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:34:59.960]   Those DeForest griffins.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.960]   What are you going to do?
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.360]   Anyway, um, she didn't say anything about where she was going either.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360]   I think she just has itchy feet.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360]   It's gotta be something.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   It's gotta be something more to that.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360]   One does wander, doesn't one?
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360]   No one moves that much on purpose.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:34.600]   Although, they've got the funds where they can do whatever the hell they want, so.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.600]   I love moving, wouldn't it be one of them for me?
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.600]   But you know what?
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.600]   To each his own.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.600]   I think when, next move, I'm going to pay people to do the whole thing instead of just
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.600]   part of it.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   And I think I won't mind then.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600]   Because I'm going to have a real job then.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600]   No, I mean, I have a real job then.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:59.600]   I mean, I have a real job now. I'm gonna be full-time, so I'll try. Okay, so you roll and pull your palm out, tumble, bumble down the hill.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   After crawling through the hole in the fence.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.600]   Your moms are gonna be so upset. No.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   Back to the inn where Galio...Galio? Galio?
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   G-Man. G-A-L-L-I-O.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:33.600]   Galio is behind the bar, doing his usual thing. He is very busy. He's got two bar maids working, and it's not enough. They're just constantly back and forth.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:41.600]   Wait, I'll help him. I was gonna say. Can I help? Hey, Galio. Can I? Need a hand? I can give you a hand.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   He's got two trays. He puts one down, grabs an apron, and throws it at you. Amazing. Can I start playing? Can I start playing? Yeah, it's not gonna stop you.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:59.600]   I throw my hat down to collect change, and I start playing. Alright, I'm passing out drinks. There you go. Now we have jobs. We're employed.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   Oh my gosh, she was almost at 20. What's your intention with your helping out?
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:21.600]   I'm trying to get to know everyone in town and see who is neutral good.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   Ah, yes. Okay, in that case, I'll call that... Perception? No, perception is taking in raw information. I'm gonna say it's an insight check, and you can't fail. It's just a matter of how this goes about.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:59.600]   17, or 18. Okay, you're gonna make money. How long are you guys gonna be at this? Well, we can't do anything right now.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   We're gonna wait for What's-His-Butt to get into town. We'll probably get here sooner now. We need to scope some people, and then we're also learning the in business and kind of schmoozing and getting a bit of a Galileo because we told them we want to start an in thing.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:35.600]   And I'm a bard, so I like trying to be known. Okay, first of all, he loves you guys. Yeah, who doesn't? Your effect on the crowd is palpable. They were already in a good mood because they were drinking and eating and they were getting paid to do nothing.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:48.600]   Now, they're having a blast. They're dancing. They're singing along with the songs they know. They're singing along with the songs they don't know. They're just making shit up. Whatever they think. You walk on water.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   They're all super impressed with you, and they easily blab about themselves. You have no trouble reading them. You're just in the zone. You're just having one of those great insight days where you just get people.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:11.600]   It happens sometimes. You've got a lot of experience sitting on bars watching people drink. Oh, I'll leave the bar. I'll have a good time. This is my place. This is your place. This is where I thrive.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:21.600]   You spent two years in this kind of a place. You would know. I have. I would know. This is very comfortable. I'm always in places like this.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:35.600]   You're both of you. No strangers to ins or pups. You can give me more specific limitations if you want, but you can find whoever you want.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:57.600]   I'd also like to know who wasn't feeling effects or upset. I need the tough one. Out of the hundredish people, probably like ten who were like, "Pfft, sissies." And they're probably the wiser ones who, when they went nearby, didn't feel like they were weird around here.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   But like you, their wisdom is higher. Their constitution is higher. They're able to withstand the psychic attacks without being too much of a problem for them.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:22.600]   And they're well known for being like that, so people just refer you to them. One of them is there now, and the other two are on different shifts, so they're asleep or something. But you get their info.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:37.600]   Oh, I do get their info. Oh yeah. Well, I mean, you get their names and riddle them out. Everybody hangs out at the inn, and if they're not at the inn, they're either at home or on a job site, or some of them will have somewhere they go to hang out.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:52.600]   Like some will go to the shore, and there's a beach within five miles, I think. Let's see. Well, it doesn't matter. It's pretty close. I'm just trying to sniff out the strong-minded.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:41:11.600]   Yeah, you have no trouble finding people who are strong-minded. You might want to get more than three, because you aren't able to tell what they're... Well, you can tell the one that you got definitely neutral good. The others, hard to say, so maybe get the names of a bunch and you can go talk to them when you get a chance.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   Yeah. What's this guy's name? What's that? What's his name? Oh, that's a great question. He's a human named...
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:48.600]   Damn. That's gotta be a fancy name. I'm gonna look up the fancy name generator. I'm looking for... Where is Fancy Folklore? No. Oh, good lord.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:42:07.600]   Is he human in here? No, of course not. Hellhound names? Hello. Hellhound? Yeah. Are they invisible? No. No, they're just... They're like a regular dog. The one that's bigger and hellish.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:24.600]   One of the people in the game that I was in before has a cloak that turns her into a hellhound. That's cool. It's cursed and she loves it. My character had the ability to get it off of her and she refused. No, I like being a hellhound.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:41.600]   That's fine. I wonder if that would make you immune to the hell air. It makes you resistant to fire and it definitely makes hell the place you can be. We should get the forge to give us hell gear eventually, later on.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   So like level 6 stuff. But imagine if we tune gear later to help us survive hell. If we decide to go there. But we should make it go to Happy Place version.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:12.600]   We should make it go to... where the hell is my grandma? Is she your grandma? I don't know. Isn't she trying to keep tabs on you or something? You know she sent you a message and you think she's probably been scrying on you based on that.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:33.600]   That's fine. For now. Okay, his name is Torvald Stone. Torvald? Torvald. Torvald. White line is Torvald except without the S. T-Stone. T-Stone? T-Stone, yeah.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:52.600]   You got that audio recording? Torvald. Stone. Okay. So yeah. Torvald is one of the cool ones and also thinks you're really cool too. Like seeing how your tiny self is easily carrying around these huge platters of food and booze and stuff.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   You don't look like you should be able to do it. And also, are you an elf or not? You're too small to be an elf. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a small being. I'm an elf.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:16.600]   But yeah. Everybody's in a good mood. You guys are in a good mood. It's so good. So you guys, let's see. What's your sleep situation? You were traveling all that time.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:28.600]   I don't think sleep deprivation really starts to be a problem for at least 24 hours. So you wouldn't really start to feel the effects until the morning, I think.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.600]   Well, we should probably. You should at least. I can sleep. You're fine. I'm fine.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   I'm going to say you guys are at the inn for what? Eight hours? Yeah. That seems like a reasonable amount. All right. So you get eight gold.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:45:08.600]   Actually, you both get eight gold. You're getting a golden hour in tips and donations. And Galio just really wants to be best buds with you guys at this point. He already wanted to, but now he sees how you're like hard workers and opportunistic and stuff.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   A guy like him really likes opportunists, people who see it as a possibility and exploit it. He sees that as a sign of strength.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   Okay. So he'll put you up in the inn for free because of what you guys have. Like you helped him out with this. You made business boom even more than I already was, and he knew because he saw the crowd before he showed up and after.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:50.600]   He doesn't know you guys caused the crowd, but he's not that smart. He puts one and one together and gets three. He's like, these guys brought this crowd like magically or something, not drove them here with whips.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   So yeah, you get free room and board here. You don't have to worry about that while you're in town. Never will, as long as you don't piss him off.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:08.600]   He's super into your ideas about writing another and loves the idea of having a fake rivalry. Like publicly having a rivalry, but privately you're both in on it.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   It's his idea. He's like, we should have a rivalry. It'd be great. We could have our customers hate each other. It'd be so good for business.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:28.600]   East and west side of town. Friday's certain events at one inn and Saturday. You know how clubs do different events on different days.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:51.600]   I'll go back. Yeah, you'll just make money. We're the silent investor. Me, you, and Galia. Never ever. We'll need some more money to see if Galia had any recommendations.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   Well, isn't Sarah's storm weather, storm hammer out of a job now? She's on her way. Moon whisper. Seraphina. Moon whisper.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:12.600]   Oh, she's on her way back to the university at water deep. No, not Seraphina. Oh, Sarah the hammer stone. Yeah. Yes.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:22.600]   No, there's tons of work in town, but it's only for the night. She's like never ever like writing in person. Yeah, she wasn't just doing that site.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   That's just where she was at the time. The whole town has construction going on and all of it needs to be coordinated and there's all of her lieutenants going around and managing stuff.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:48.600]   They're preparing for, so they're building up barracks. They're building, the church is underway. It's a generic church because this world has lots of gods and they're all real.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:48:00.600]   I'm rolling my eyes so hard right now. Next game I run will not be in this world.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   Yeah, and the church they're building is just the stand-in church for people that don't build their own churches.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:13.600]   All of the people who want to drum up business will bring their own stuff and make their own churches. That's kind of how things are in this world.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:39.600]   Now, long rest, of course, so you get all your points back and slots and all that. Next day, I'll see, so you, we'll say you wake up around 2 p.m. ish.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:51.600]   I have a note from Sarah saying never Ember will be here day after today.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:49:08.600]   Well, she sent it last night. No, she sent it while you were asleep this morning and so relative to that note, it's tomorrow and it is also actually tomorrow, so she'll be here tomorrow and wants to talk to you.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.600]   Oh my gosh, do we ever.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.600]   We want to start it in and there's a help portal down the road.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.600]   These things may be related.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:25.600]   By the way, song group.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:41.600]   Call me that.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.600]   How many birds.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   The goal is to get 20 birds.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:11.600]   So you've got a day if there's any preparation you want to do for the arrival of first name number.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:17.600]   I'm going to have to go to the Wiki for that.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.600]   I didn't reset things.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   Just click on the square.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   A little red thing.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   Looking for the long rest.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   Your spell slots.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   You just click it.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.600]   It goes away.
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:42.600]   For a whole family I think developed is the one that. Yes, open water of water deep or.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:49.600]   Or is it somebody else.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:58.600]   I'm going to grab my notes.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   Remember.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.600]   In war.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:11.600]   Maybe here.
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   I'll just take this.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.600]   There we go.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:38.600]   I'm sorry about this.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:41.600]   That's wrong.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.600]   Okay.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.600]   His name is first name is not Lord.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.600]   Okay.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.600]   Yes, I need to remember to build.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600]   Okay.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:56.600]   Yeah, so the goal will be here tomorrow.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.600]   Let's meet with you.
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600]   We'll look for you at the end.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:05.600]   Unless you tell Sarah otherwise.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:11.600]   Is there anything you want to do between now and then.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.600]   So what are what are our focuses.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   We got portal stuff.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.600]   We got in stuff.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:23.600]   What do we want to do you need anything ready before we talk to him.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.600]   I would like to ask.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.600]   Gallio how much it's going to cost.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.600]   He thinks to start up and in so we have some sort of business plan when we talk to.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.600]   Never ever.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.600]   So that we actually know what we're doing and then.
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.600]   And then maybe.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:47.600]   Is there like a library nearby.
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.600]   In this town.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.600]   No, not yet.
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:56.600]   Well, there's somebody who really likes books and they started a collection there.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:04.600]   So maybe so because we might want to study like stuff on the portal stuff.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   You probably won't find anything like that.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.600]   This town is not a town of magic users.
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:16.600]   Yeah, I think if we know anything it's going to be.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   So just Gallio for the info and then we want to start tracking down the neutral goods right.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.600]   Yeah, I've got one damn.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:30.600]   So they will go talk to him and go talk to the other ones.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:34.600]   Yeah, it's normal and friends.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   Claude's working on the answer to your question.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.600]   No.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.600]   What question.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.600]   How much it costs to start me.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:52.600]   Do you need to eat.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:56.600]   Grab some food.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.600]   Food's free here because you guys are so you don't have to worry about that.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:12.600]   Only storm storm him know Hammerstone Hammerstone said that they would pay our room and board.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:36.600]   The first came to my house.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:48.600]   Well, it's a long answer.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.600]   Claude really knows what's up in this story.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.600]   Interesting.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.600]   I keep forgetting that that it has access to all of them.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.600]   That is probably about right.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.600]   It's OK.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:09.600]   You're looking at I'm just gonna say you're talking to Gallio slow times.
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:12.600]   He's got he's doing some back of the envelope stuff.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.600]   He says, well, depending on how you do it, it could be anywhere from two to four thousand.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.600]   Oh, we're nowhere close.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.600]   Yeah, I learned 91.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.600]   Yeah, he says, I could spot you.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:33.600]   91. That's crazy. I could spot 250 in the short term.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.600]   More if you want to work out some kind of investment thing that I can't I can't put 2000 together right now.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:44.600]   I got too many sticks in the fire.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:45.600]   That's not right.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.600]   We're going to we're going to.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:59.600]   I got too much money in the fire. Oh, shit.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.600]   Yeah. And that low number is where you guys build it.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:15.600]   So our our plan is thinking that Neverember might want might front the builders for it once we tell them everything that's going on.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.600]   And they might invest some money and then we'll just work on coming up with the rest.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.600]   So we don't need money yet.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.600]   We just want to know. Right.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.600]   Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.600]   Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.600]   I mean, no rush.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.600]   Nobody else has had the idea yet.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:33.600]   I can't do it.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:39.600]   I'm already running this place, but I'm really looking forward to having you guys across wherever you decide to set up.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.600]   I think it'd be best if we were within eyesight of each other so that we could sling insults.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:46.600]   Yeah, it was just across the street.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.600]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to telling my unruly guests to go over to your place.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.600]   Yeah, I'll take care of them.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.600]   I don't doubt it.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.600]   I see how you would handle customers.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.600]   Actually, yeah, it would be fun.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.600]   When you threw that guy out the other last night, I couldn't believe it.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.600]   On hand.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600]   It was just me.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:15.600]   Yeah, you guys did like a prattle.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.600]   He ran at you.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   You went like this.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:18.600]   You jumped and rolled.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:20.600]   Yes.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.600]   Yeah, you guys put on a real good show.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   What else?
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.600]   Oh, estimated the revenue, too.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.600]   Nice.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.600]   Claude, thanks.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:41.600]   For the most expensive approach, six to eight weeks to get it set up
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.600]   and potential 50 to 80 gold pieces a week of profit.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.600]   All right.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:53.600]   Eight to 10 rooms, meals and drinks, three to five gold pieces a day.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   So your guys' one gold piece an hour was ridiculous.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.600]   That was way more than you should have gotten.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.600]   But they just loved you guys so much.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.600]   You know really well.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.600]   Also, the scheme you guys have figured out is really cool.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.600]   I'm a fan.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.600]   I'm a fan of you guys.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.600]   Well, the real money is in the back room business
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.600]   of accepting dangerous and magical quests.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.600]   That's where we'll get our money.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   That ends up front for a real business.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.600]   Facts.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:29.600]   I forgot about that.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.600]   We need something for tax purposes.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:35.600]   Yeah, something to launder our money through.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:41.600]   To show the local lords we're on the up and up.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:42.600]   That's right.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:43.600]   That's right.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.600]   Because when people come in, we'll hear people's stories left and right.
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.600]   And we'll just pick the ones that we're like, oh, you know.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:52.600]   Well, then in the future, the goal is if you have so much money,
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:54.600]   we just set up inns in every town.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:58.600]   And people just send us messages for requests.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.600]   Oh.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:16.600]   And we're still multi-planet, business-planet.
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:19.600]   See those eyes.
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.600]   And the little paws.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.600]   Little paws.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.600]   Little paws.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.600]   Tiny paws.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:26.600]   They don't care.
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:34.600]   Okay.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.600]   Let's see.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:39.600]   Anything else you guys want to do today?
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:41.600]   That's a pretty good stock.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:44.600]   We'll just track down the guys, right?
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.600]   Let's do it.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.600]   We've still got an hour and a change of gameplay left.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.600]   Oh, shit.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:52.600]   It's only $4.50.
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.600]   Did you talk to Torval?
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.600]   Did you talk to him already?
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.600]   Yeah, you've got the other people to talk to.
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.600]   Torval's gave you the names of other people.
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.600]   You can go talk to them.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:03.600]   Let's go talk to Torval and friends.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.600]   Let's go talk to Torval and friends and get a little crew ready for --
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:11.600]   because when we tell Neverember we're in, we need to have a plan.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.600]   I'm sure he'll appreciate everything being taken care of already.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.600]   It does let people who have initiative take initiative.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   Let's just tell him, look, this is what we're doing.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:25.600]   Or we'll tell him.
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.600]   Let's see.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:33.600]   So let me go look at this list of names that Torval gave me.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:39.600]   So you've got four -- I need to get some names.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:01:02.600]   Let's go back up here on top of these names.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.600]   Whoops.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:04.600]   I don't know how that works.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:06.600]   Badger.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.600]   Badger.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.600]   Do-do-do.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.600]   If we start an import/export business out of the portal room --
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:16.600]   Oh, my God.
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.600]   -- and Neverember is like, okay, you want this crate of goods sent to the other side
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:27.600]   of the planet, okay, 1,000 gold, and then we ship it up.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:28.600]   Like if we mastered the world --
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.600]   You're going to make your own SpaceX?
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:32.600]   Yeah, we're like -- yeah, exactly.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.600]   Okay.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.600]   That's crazy -- import/export.
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:38.600]   Import/export, yeah.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.600]   They drop it off to us at the end, but what they don't know --
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:42.600]   We'll start with the end, but --
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:47.600]   -- is we just wagon it up to the cave, and then only me, you,
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.600]   and the associates that we hire plus Neverember knows.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.600]   And then us and Neverember get a rich off of it.
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:55.600]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:56.600]   Import/export business.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:57.600]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:58.600]   They're a portal.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:59.600]   They're a portal.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.600]   For Neverember's portal.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.600]   Forget shipping.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:03.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.600]   We're going to absolutely positively have to be there yesterday.
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:17.600]   Okay, so you've got four more dudes and five more ladies, contact info.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.600]   Okay.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:27.600]   Do you want to -- how far into this do you want to zoom?
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:35.600]   We can gloss over the interview process, or if you prefer, we can play it out?
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:41.600]   I really just want to know who doesn't have anything better to do.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.600]   You just know if they meet their requirements.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:48.600]   If they touch the thing, it's going to work.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   And also, can you like, keep it secret?
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.600]   Well, yeah, secrecy.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.600]   And then constitution, are they going to be able to --
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:58.600]   which I think kind of already got established,
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.600]   because that's how we found out about these people.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:04.600]   Yeah, these people are all able to stand it.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:10.600]   The only question is how they treat other people, basically.
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:22.600]   So let's -- I'll just pick -- how do we do this?
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.600]   I'll take these three.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.600]   And two of these.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.600]   And I will -- I'll just go ahead and say these are the ones
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.600]   that you think are probably neutral good.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.600]   Tord Hall definitely is, but Edric Brennan,
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:50.600]   Kathra, Marjoryd, and Eldeth might be.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.600]   So these sound like they're probably neutral good.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:55.600]   They're all probably good.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:58.600]   How lawful or chaotic they are, hard to say,
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.600]   but you'll be able to tell when you meet them.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.600]   You have them -- I imagine some of them all get in.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:07.600]   They come at different times, but --
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.600]   Is that Tord Hall?
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:15.600]   They're all still waiting for new orders anyway.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.600]   Well, they just found out that when they went for their shift
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.600]   that they don't have a shift.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:34.600]   And so they come back in and -- yeah.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.600]   You know that there's -- I'm sitting there with the pint
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.600]   and my feet up, kicked back in the chair,
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:45.600]   waiting for my minions to come.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:50.600]   Okay, well, let's just say -- we'll just go with Edric
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:58.600]   and Kathra, and we'll save the rest for later.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:02.600]   So Torvald Stone, Edric Moss, and Kathra Ironfoot
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.600]   are ready to help you with your quest.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.600]   Excellent.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.600]   And they all have experience in the mines,
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.600]   so they can take you to the place just as well as anybody else.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.600]   You could probably find it yourselves now
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:21.600]   because you're smart and you've been to and from.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.600]   And you also know what markings on the wall
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:29.600]   indicate the way to the bad things.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.600]   So you go up there after recruiting these guys.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:41.600]   The site is dead now, other than that there are guards posted.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:49.600]   But one of them's the guy you met at the edge of town yesterday last night.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.600]   He was near the end of his shift last time,
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:06:00.600]   and now he's at the start of his shift and says, "Oh, hey. What's going on?"
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:02.600]   Oh, hey.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:09.600]   We're working on fixing the problem.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.600]   In the cave.
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:12.600]   I thought it was too dangerous to be here.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.600]   It is. That's why we're here.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   For the week. That's why you're here.
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:24.600]   Don't let anyone else in without us or Hammer Storm.
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:26.600]   Sarah Hammer Storm.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.600]   Stone.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.600]   Stone Lady.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:32.600]   Even I forget.
[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:35.600]   Don't let anyone else in besides us.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:41.600]   I didn't even have orders to let you in.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:43.600]   You can go in. It's fine.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:44.600]   Who are these three?
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:50.600]   Oh, yeah. Thordvald, Kathra, and Edric?
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:54.600]   Kathra Blushes.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:55.600]   Edric.
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:00.600]   He's a handsome guard.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.600]   And you guys step under the rope and proceed to the site.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:09.600]   And of course, there's nobody to be seen.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.600]   Thordvald leaves because he was the first he would talk with.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:17.600]   He lights the lights that need to be lit.
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:23.600]   You head down with your hard hats on.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:28.600]   You get to the hole. There's no visible difference.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:32.600]   But who knows?
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:36.600]   Alright, and what do we do?
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:44.600]   Okay, so we know we have to have these people with their hands on the walls, right?
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:51.600]   And that will unlock it and allow us to repair it, right?
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:53.600]   Fix the alignment.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600]   It's only detuned. It's not broken.
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:57.600]   There's no error messages showing.
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:03.600]   It's just saying not currently tuned and also danger because it's not tuned.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:08.600]   So with them unlocking it, we should be able to figure out how to tune it.
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:12.600]   To give you another idea of what this tuning thing is like,
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:17.600]   if you imagine an out-of-tune piano, how awful it sounds,
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:20.600]   now imagine that that is the fabric of reality.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.600]   That's why it has to be around.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:30.600]   Okay, so they listen intently. They have questions to answer them.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:40.600]   Edrick seems like maybe he's not as brave as he was supposedly,
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:45.600]   but he doesn't want to be the one that messes it up, so he goes along with this stuff.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:47.600]   He just seems a little nervous.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.600]   He gives them careful instructions not to cross the circle.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.600]   And the three of them go in and find their corners and put their hands to the walls.
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:00.600]   And you can cast your spell again if you want.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.600]   You're going to need to anyway to actually operate this thing.
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.600]   So go ahead and mark that off if you're doing that.
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:07.600]   You've got an hour of...
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:09.600]   Well, I think it's still going.
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:11.600]   It's only an hour, isn't it?
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:12.600]   We were gone.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:14.600]   You've slept since then.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:17.600]   Yeah, I don't know how to...
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.600]   I would also like to pass a quarter of inspiration on there.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:23.600]   Oh, okay. In case anything comes up.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.600]   Yeah, and play my... I don't think my trumpet's been expended since whatever before,
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.600]   but if it has been, I would...
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.600]   You've charged it. Cool. That's fair.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:36.600]   All right. Well, I'm comprehending languages.
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.600]   Excellent. So you can see the analysis process.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.600]   And let me look at the questions here.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:52.600]   Yeah, they easily pass these tests.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.600]   How big is this room?
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.600]   20 feet in every dimension. So a 20-foot cube.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.600]   That's like two stories high.
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:10.600]   Yeah. It seems way taller than it used to be, but it's containing the rift.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.600]   Or rather, it encapsulates the rift.
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.600]   It's probably not the room itself that contains it.
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.600]   It's probably some other mechanism at play.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.600]   They pass, and all four corners, even the one that didn't have somebody at it,
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:34.600]   suddenly the stuff pops out of the walls of dials and keyboards and all kinds of stuff.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:37.600]   It's all netherese, but you can comprehend it.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.600]   Good skill.
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.600]   It's a really good skill, or spell.
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.600]   The three of them are like, "What?"
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:52.600]   Let's just have it.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.600]   Thanks, guys.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.600]   Hold on a second. I've got to see if any of them panicked.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.600]   Can we wipe their bellies?
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:01.600]   Do you have anything for that?
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.600]   Let's see if it's...
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.600]   Wow!
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.600]   They actually are super chill, and they rolled 12, 15, and 18 on the dial.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.600]   I picked the best people.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.600]   You picked the best people, and at first they're startled,
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.600]   but then they see you looking at it, and they read the room,
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:26.600]   and they're like, "These guys know what they're doing.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.600]   These are some badass people. These might be the main characters in this world."
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.600]   That's sick.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:38.600]   You now actually have minions, if you want them.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.600]   Hell yeah.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.600]   They just leveled up to level one because of this.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:46.600]   This was a formative experience.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.600]   Before that, they were really close to getting up to level one.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:52.600]   Maybe we hire them later.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.600]   Absolutely.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.600]   They'll probably want to work for us.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:58.600]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:00.600]   You don't even have to roll for that.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:02.600]   They definitely want to work for you.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:04.600]   They think you guys are cool.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.600]   Look at that. We don't even need to ask what's its face for the staff.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.600]   You've got to start anyway.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:12.600]   You're going to need more than the three of them.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.600]   Depending on what hours you want.
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:18.600]   We'll talk about that later.
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:24.600]   The controls pop out, and you have no problem figuring out what's what.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:28.600]   It has a whole system.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:32.600]   It has selectors for...
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.600]   I'm going to say genre, but that's not exactly right.
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.600]   You can pick what kind of place you're trying to find.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.600]   It gives feedback about what's nearby.
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:52.600]   It says currently that it is tuned to the outspirts of hell, but it's off by a bit.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:58.600]   There's a button that you can hit that retunes it if you want to do that.
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:02.600]   Do you want to hit the retune button?
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:04.600]   Well, we want to tune it.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:12.600]   But once it's tuned, is it going to be tuned in hell?
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:16.600]   It will be tuned to the place that it currently is.
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.600]   It will be no longer a dangerous part of it.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.600]   It will be a stable part, and people won't have pain in their heads.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.600]   But something can come out of it.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:32.600]   Is it at the same location, but it's stable, or is it a different location?
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.600]   There's different controls for location.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.600]   So we can tune it without...
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:46.600]   You can change the X, the Y, the Z, the W, the U, the V.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:48.600]   You can't change the time, though.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.600]   So it's anywhere currently existing, but we can basically up, down, we can do wherever.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:56.600]   We can point it somewhere.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:02.600]   It's in the middle of the inside of an ocean, and because of the way this thing works,
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.600]   it's powered by the energy differences between planes.
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.600]   It taps into...
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:14.600]   In fact, you know this because the readout tells you how much different potential energy is available,
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:24.600]   how much power is available, the flow rate of how able it is to keep its batteries charged and stuff.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:30.600]   And you can guess from that that if you tuned it to your own plane, it wouldn't get any charge out of it.
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:32.600]   Because there's no difference.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:34.600]   It's a water-seeking its own level type of thing.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:42.600]   Doesn't matter if it's lower or higher, just the ability to put some barrier between the two sides
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.600]   and control that is enough for it.
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:48.600]   Which also implies that it has some kind of equivalent to a heat sink somewhere
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:54.600]   spilling some kind of energy out to somewhere because no machine is perfectly efficient.
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.600]   But it might not be on this plane, too.
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.600]   Not our plane, not our problem.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:08.600]   There might be some horrible plane out there somewhere that's got magic heat falling on this little village.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.600]   It's like space trash.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:16.600]   Yeah, we've got to tune it, and then we'll point it somewhere else.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.600]   Let's tune it. Something crazy is going to come out the second we tune it.
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:22.600]   Tune it.
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:30.600]   Okay, so you hit it and it very smoothly goes "zoop" and the portal ceases to be spherical
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:40.600]   and becomes a plane, a flat plane that is trapezoidal.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:50.600]   Like a doorway, ten feet high, six feet wide at the bottom, and four feet wide at the top.
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:52.600]   Something like that.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.600]   And you can see perfectly through it.
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:00.600]   It's exactly what you saw before, but now there's no distortion.
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:06.600]   It's just this desolate plane with no wind and there's sand.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:14.600]   If you wanted, you could just reach and grab some of the sand through the portal and trickle it on the floor or whatever.
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:20.600]   But also you know more certainly than ever with your 29 or Nat 20 from before.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.600]   It's exactly where you thought.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:26.600]   It is a part of hell, but it's really, really far from anything.
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:28.600]   Because if it were anywhere closer to...
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.600]   Oh, that's the other thing. You can go around, you can walk around it and see.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.600]   Even if you're on the other side, you still see through.
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:44.600]   It's exactly like Portal, the game, except the portal is two-sided in the sense that you can look through either way.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:46.600]   So as I walk around it changes.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:54.600]   It goes like this, and then when you get to the other side, you're seeing the other side of the other plane.
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.600]   You're basically looking behind you.
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:04.600]   But can the plane see in does? Yeah, if there's anything.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:08.600]   But you can walk all the way around it, there's nothing.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:10.600]   Nothing within vision.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:15.600]   As far as the horizon is away, and you can also tell because you've experienced adventure,
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.600]   that this is a much flatter plane than the surface of this planet that you're used to.
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:27.600]   It's going really far, the horizon is really far away, and there's nothing.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.600]   There's no mountains, no buildings, nothing.
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.600]   It's just red sand.
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:39.600]   I think we should work on changing it somewhere else.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:47.600]   So your changing options are, there are presets that have been saved, locations that the original operators located.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:56.600]   They have found all of the familiar planes, the Feywau, which is where your people are from.
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:01.600]   Of course they found the planes of hell, or the plane of hell.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:14.600]   They found the plane that the Cthulhu people are from, the elephants, the mind flayers.
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:22.600]   They found the celestial plane, which is the opposite of hell.
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:29.600]   And some others that you don't recognize because you have no frame of reference.
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.600]   It's telling you the literal meaning, but you don't know what the literal meaning means because it doesn't mean anything to you.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:36.600]   It's out of kin.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.600]   Without having been there or had it described to you or something, you just have no way.
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:46.600]   Because it doesn't describe the place, it's just the place.
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:52.600]   The rest you know just from other places.
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:19:00.600]   I was just saying, I wonder if that's where the Nettorese people went when they disappeared 400 years ago, if they're on another plane.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:07.600]   That's a great idea, I'm going to make that true.
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.600]   And also there are, from the system you can get notes.
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:16.600]   Because they have of course a way of making notes about places and things like that.
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:22.600]   And from the notes it's easy to tell that this was an experiment, and that their intention was to make a bigger one.
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.600]   And you don't know what happened with that.
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:37.600]   I think it seems like it's almost safer pointing it at the emptiness of Hell than pointing it at a new plane.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.600]   It's a safe bet, nothing from Hell is going to come from here because it's so far away.
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:47.600]   The XYZ had been dialed so far from Hellish civilization.
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:53.600]   It would take weeks for something to come from Hell to this portal.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:20:01.600]   So we're just thinking either that, or we point it at the celestial place just somewhere in the sky.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:07.600]   Maybe we have to deal with angels coming through and they're their own problem.
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:11.600]   I mean you can do it every one, everything has two sides.
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:18.600]   But that's what I mean, right now where it's pointed, pretty certain nothing is going to come through.
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:24.600]   All three of the people with you went "ahhh" when it went through.
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:28.600]   They feel completely fine now and they think you're even more godly.
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:30.600]   Nice.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:32.600]   So you just want to leave it pointed at Hell?
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:34.600]   Yeah.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:37.600]   Should we raise it in the air a little bit?
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:39.600]   So if something goes through they'll fall and die?
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:41.600]   Sorry.
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:48.600]   What if something does come in?
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:50.600]   Because nothing in Hell flies, right?
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:52.600]   No, probably.
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.600]   Don't demons have wings?
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:56.600]   Probably.
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.600]   That's what I was saying.
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:04.600]   Because if something is flying around or walking around, they could see into that room.
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:12.600]   They will see it from a distance because unless they're side onto it, they'll see black.
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:15.600]   Yeah, because it's just like a portal in the middle of nowhere.
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.600]   And on the other side of the portal is this black room.
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:19.600]   So it would stand out.
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:21.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:24.600]   It probably would be seen from pretty far away.
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:29.600]   As long as they're not right on those five degrees of where it's basically invisible.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.600]   Yeah, the other 350 degrees.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.600]   Because right now we pretty much know for a fact that nothing is going to come through.
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:39.600]   How do we know that?
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:42.600]   Because Robert said it like four times.
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.600]   I'm so nervous.
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:49.600]   You can take a few checks for that.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.600]   Because he said it.
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:53.600]   That's going to be next week's monster raise.
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:58.600]   Well actually, Demon Lord Boo Boo comes through.
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:00.600]   Alright, well do you want to leave it then?
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:01.600]   Alright, whatever.
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.600]   For now.
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:04.600]   Alright.
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:12.600]   Yeah, so Torval, Edric, and Kathra are still, they are absolutely going to keep their swearing to secrecy.
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:15.600]   Because they see why it's important.
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:18.600]   They're not stupid, they get old.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:22.600]   Be quiet.
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:27.600]   Yes, so that's cool.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:36.600]   And you make your way back and get a head nod from that guard whose name I don't have handy.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.600]   If I ever gave him one.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:39.600]   I don't know.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.600]   It's a guard boy.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:48.600]   And yeah, I think you get back to the inn around evening.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:52.600]   What do you want to tell your buddies about next?
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:56.600]   What do you want them to, like should they go back to work in town?
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:22:59.600]   Or wait for orders from you?
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:04.600]   Yeah, go back to work and when we have another assignment you'll be the first to know.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:07.600]   And it's all going to be cool stuff like that.
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:09.600]   They're down for it, right?
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.600]   Start training.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:14.600]   They've never been part of a story before.
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:16.600]   And they know a story when they see it.
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.600]   We got a story for you.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:23.600]   Do they have, or can they have later, like their own, would they have their own classes formed?
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:24.600]   Or do they already?
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:33.600]   They're all going to be minors.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:40.600]   But that means they could be, well none of them are going to be magical.
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:55.600]   They could be healers or fighters, so they could be, I guess a cleric, a fighter, a monk, a...
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:59.600]   What if we kind of run a little group?
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:01.600]   You can do that if you want.
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:08.600]   You're going to have to run the extra people though because I decided running two characters in addition to everything else.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:10.600]   That's fair, that's fair.
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:15.600]   Didn't we need stuff mined for the crystals?
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.600]   Yeah, we could send them up for adventure.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:25.600]   We could have a ranger, we could have Rick take them to the mountains.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.600]   Yeah, so there's two different things they could be able to do.
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:35.600]   Yeah, or we could just keep having them mine for us only.
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:38.600]   Oh, one more thing.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:41.600]   You know where the actual door is now.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:44.600]   The hole in the wall is not the door.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:52.600]   There is a control for reopening the door, and it's just like how the controls showed up out of nowhere from the wall.
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:55.600]   The door, I'm assuming you're not opening it.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:56.600]   Yeah.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.600]   There's a door, I'm opening it.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:08.600]   Yeah, Star Trek style. It opens up and there's a cool air in there.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:15.600]   There's a hallway and dim light and it goes somewhere.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:18.600]   Oh, like deeper into?
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:21.600]   Just level, a little more.
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:24.600]   It's hard to say whether it's going to go deeper or shallower.
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:31.600]   I was curious why it's just some random room, there's probably like a complex.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:41.600]   Yeah, it's part of stuff, but it's also over a thousand years old and nobody knows where the other end of that hole is.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.600]   Let's go.
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:50.600]   We have a day, or actually no, because we went back to town in the evening and then never immersed in heaven in the morning.
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:54.600]   Tomorrow morning about tomorrow at some point.
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:00.600]   Look, we found a netherese base with a portal to other planes.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.600]   Please invest in our inn.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.600]   He's like, wait, what, inn?
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:08.600]   Yes.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:09.600]   He's like, god.
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:10.600]   We are in business.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.600]   A lot's happened, sir.
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:17.600]   A lot's happened since you've been gone from your own family.
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.600]   He comes back from vacation, who are you guys?
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:25.600]   Pretty much took over his town.
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:32.600]   Okay, so you dismiss your underlings and you're hanging out at the inn.
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:36.600]   Is there anything you want to do before tomorrow?
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.600]   If it's still evening, I'd play again.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:40.600]   Okay.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:41.600]   Make some money.
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:42.600]   Yeah, you'll make another.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.600]   I'll serve again.
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.600]   Okay, we'll each make another three gold, I guess.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:48.600]   Three?
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:49.600]   It's $150.
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:50.600]   You guys are doing really well.
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:58.600]   I just, I know a lot of people in hospitality and they make so much money and tips on the good nights.
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:26:59.600]   Yeah.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:00.600]   Three gold?
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.600]   I'm about it.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:10.600]   My friend Kelly just got a job as a sales for a booze distributor and she's doing great.
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:12.600]   She's a bartender.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.600]   Anyway.
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.600]   Okay, so next day.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:24.600]   We've been through two days in one session and previously it took us five sessions to go through two days.
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:27.600]   It took us one session to get through one door one time.
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:28.600]   Yeah.
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:29.600]   We couldn't make a decision.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.600]   That was rough.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:31.600]   I forgot about that.
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.600]   I was okay with you putting timers on us, by the way.
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.600]   Yeah.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.600]   Well, I mean, I tried to do that in the back of my mind, too, of like, if they take a really long time here, what's going to happen?
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:42.600]   What else is going on?
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.600]   What's going on with Small's grandma?
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:49.600]   What's going on with the rest of the Lords of whatever?
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:51.600]   What's going on with the rest of the world?
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.600]   I'm trying to think about that stuff.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.600]   I actually have a page that covers all of the timers.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:58.600]   Well, it's over to your grandma's school, too.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:27:59.600]   Somebody knows.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:02.600]   She's kind of a big deal in another part of the world.
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:04.600]   But not another plane.
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:10.600]   No, on this plane and also on the faith plane, on those two planes, she's kind of a big deal.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.600]   Boom clocks.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:18.600]   They'll probably be, like, mad that we opened a portal there.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:19.600]   Yeah.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:20.600]   What's up, family?
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.600]   Hey, Bim!
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.600]   It's me, Small.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:25.600]   How long is this segment?
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:27.600]   I think it's okay.
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:45.600]   Okay, next morning, I'm thinking about what the best way for him to show up is.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:53.600]   He will stroll into the inn late in the morning.
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:29:02.600]   And he'll have had a description of you guys from Sarah, so he'll recognize you right away.
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.600]   "Hi there, I'm a daggle never-end bird.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.600]   I take it you are a small and somber bird?"
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:09.600]   What's that?
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:10.600]   Nice speech.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.600]   Thank you for coming.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:12.600]   Likewise.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:15.600]   Thank you for your help.
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:19.600]   Of course, the message spell doesn't allow for a lot.
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:23.600]   So I don't know everything that we told Sarah.
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:28.600]   Let's go somewhere private in case this is sensitive.
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:29.600]   Perfect.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:30.600]   Tiny hut.
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:31.600]   In the inn?
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.600]   No one knows.
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:33.600]   I mean, it still takes up space.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:34.600]   But you're just going to do that.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:35.600]   Perfect.
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:36.600]   Tiny hut.
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:37.600]   I'm very powerful.
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:51.600]   No, that's okay.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:59.600]   He leads you to his own office that's in another building in town.
[02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.600]   It's nice.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.600]   It's not fancy or expensive.
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:12.600]   It's just nicer than all of the freshly thrown-up stuff that hasn't had any extra work done to it.
[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:17.600]   It's actually livable, I guess you could say, and maintained and stuff.
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:23.600]   It's what a lord would use as an office.
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:27.600]   He offers you beverages and all that stuff, and you get all the night-night formalities out of the way.
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:31.600]   So, tell me what exactly you found.
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:32.600]   Hell portal.
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:33.600]   Excuse me?
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:35.600]   I think I misheard you.
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.600]   Hell portal.
[02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:37.600]   No, you didn't.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:38.600]   Did you say a search?
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:39.600]   Did you say a hell portal?
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.600]   Yep, found a hell portal.
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:47.600]   You found a portal to hell in your mind, which is why it's closed.
[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:51.600]   Yeah, we closed it down because it was scrambling everyone's brain.
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:54.600]   So, get this, portal not tuned.
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:57.600]   We found three people, went back down, tuned it.
[02:30:57.600 --> 02:30:59.600]   Hell portal is wide open.
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:00.600]   What do you mean tuned?
[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:01.600]   We fixed it.
[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:05.600]   It has, what, a frequency?
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:07.600]   Yeah, ish.
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:11.600]   You know that it has multiple frequencies, that there are different dimensions.
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:13.600]   It doesn't just have A.
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:15.600]   Yes, it goes different dimensions.
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:17.600]   It has.
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:27.600]   We're the only ones that can use it because we understand memories, which also your mind is built on A.
[02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:28.600]   He makes a note.
[02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:29.600]   Memories.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:32.600]   Yeah, basically your mind is a netherese face.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.600]   Currently, portal, face towards hell plane.
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:36.600]   Which is open.
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:37.600]   Which is why it's the hell portal.
[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:40.600]   You can roll me inside, go away.
[02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:42.600]   I know this is a lot.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.600]   He's like barely woken up.
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:46.600]   I thought it was three.
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:47.600]   What is it?
[02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:48.600]   Insight?
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:50.600]   What about you?
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.600]   Alright.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.600]   Twenty.
[02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:53.600]   Jesus.
[02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:55.600]   He planches.
[02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:58.600]   His face goes a little bit white like he's some ghost.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:00.600]   Netherese?
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.600]   Why do you say that?
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:04.600]   Oh, because I read it.
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:06.600]   There was netherese writing?
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:08.600]   Yeah, and I read it.
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:10.600]   In the portal room.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:12.600]   He's looking really upset right now.
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:14.600]   In your portal room in your mind.
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:15.600]   Scramble some more.
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:19.600]   Well, let's just call it a netherese base rather than a mine at this point.
[02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:21.600]   There's more base than mine.
[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:23.600]   We're not sure of it.
[02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:25.600]   We have not explored it yet.
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:26.600]   You can hire us to.
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:31.600]   Yeah, or you could invest in our business adventures.
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:33.600]   What?
[02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.600]   What?
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:37.600]   So your town needs another inn.
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:43.600]   And we're your people for the low price of $2.99.
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:45.600]   You want to start an inn?
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:51.600]   Well, because you see, now that no one can work in the mine, there's just a bunch of people.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.600]   They'll find jobs.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:56.600]   Right, but the inn can't handle them.
[02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:57.600]   Oh.
[02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.600]   We've spoken with Gertritch or.
[02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:00.600]   Galio.
[02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:02.600]   Mr. G.
[02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:03.600]   And he's on board.
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:04.600]   He recommended it.
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.600]   Oh, that's great.
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:06.600]   He said he would invest.
[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:07.600]   Yeah.
[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:08.600]   Really?
[02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:09.600]   We just need some labor.
[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.600]   Yeah, so.
[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:11.600]   Well, we've got plenty of labor now.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.600]   Just an inn and a hell portal and an netherese base.
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:13.600]   That's the update.
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:15.600]   What would you like to do with that?
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:16.600]   That piece of information.
[02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:23.600]   So how do you know it's hell?
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:28.600]   Oh, because we're a noble background and we studied it and we just know.
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:30.600]   I looked at it and I know.
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:31.600]   It's not like sulfur.
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:32.600]   It's hot.
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:33.600]   We saw it.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:34.600]   It's not.
[02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:35.600]   It's not.
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:36.600]   Let me put your mind at ease here.
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:37.600]   It's basically the Sahara Desert of Hell.
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.600]   Nothing's coming through.
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:39.600]   It's the outskirts of the first layer.
[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:40.600]   So like we're good.
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:47.600]   But also still hell.
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:48.600]   But still hell.
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:49.600]   Still scary.
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:50.600]   Still open.
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:51.600]   And you say there's netherese writing and only you can, what, operate it?
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:52.600]   Is that what you said?
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:53.600]   Well, we're the only ones who know how.
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:54.600]   What operations does it have?
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:55.600]   What else does it do besides be there?
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:56.600]   It can point to different places.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:57.600]   It can point to different places.
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:58.600]   It can point to different places.
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:33:59.600]   You can point to different places.
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:00.600]   It can point to different places.
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:01.600]   It can point to different places.
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:13.240]   You can point to different places.
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:24.880]   You can point to different places.
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:36.960]   And it points to a fey plane, you know, my fan group, but, you know, who knows what's
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:37.960]   going to go through there.
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:38.960]   Where else does it go?
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:39.960]   It goes to three planes that I didn't know about.
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:40.960]   Well, the line flares and the deep speak.
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:41.960]   Right.
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:42.960]   Can you give me an idea of how big of a deal this is?
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.960]   I'll just tell you out of character.
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:44.960]   Planeshift is a 7th level spell.
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:45.960]   So you have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids.
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:46.960]   You have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids.
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:47.960]   You have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids.
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:48.960]   You have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids.
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:49.960]   You have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids.
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:56.960]   You have to be level 13 to cast it for cleric's druids, sorcerers, warlocks, and withers, and
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:57.960]   everybody.
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:58.960]   Oh, this is the legacy version.
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:34:59.960]   Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:00.960]   It's close enough.
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:10.800]   And it takes a forked metal rod with at least 250 gold pieces, tuned to a particular plane
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:12.280]   of existence.
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:21.000]   So just being able to point to a plane without having to have a tuned rod is incredible.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000]   Yeah.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000]   We just need three miners.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.000]   You can sell those rods.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.400]   We just need three miners of a very particular mindset in the leaf system we found.
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:33.560]   Which we won't tell you what it is because we'll take you inside.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:34.560]   Yeah.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:35.560]   But we already have.
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.560]   You're actually saying that?
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:37.560]   No.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:38.560]   Okay.
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:39.560]   Yes.
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:40.560]   I was going to have to figure out how to react to that.
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.560]   We got a crew.
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:42.560]   Oh, wow.
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:43.560]   We trained them.
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:44.560]   They were your crew.
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.560]   We'll say Sarah was impressed.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:46.560]   They were your crew.
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:47.560]   We tipped them.
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.560]   Okay.
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:49.560]   And you want me to invest in your inn?
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:50.560]   Yep.
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:51.560]   Okay.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:52.560]   I'm sure we can work something out.
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:53.560]   Perfect.
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:36:10.560]   I need to understand better what the security situation is here.
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:11.560]   Nothing's going to come through, you said?
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:12.560]   No.
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.560]   You said you could point it somewhere else.
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:14.560]   Can you point it somewhere more benign?
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:15.560]   Yes.
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:16.560]   Sure.
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:17.560]   That would be a great idea.
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:24.560]   I wish I would have said that before.
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:28.320]   Okay.
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:34.240]   What sort of terms do you want for operating this thing for me?
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:37.520]   I need you to, well, secure it.
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:42.480]   I need you to, I can give you guards, but I need you to be the subject matter experts
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:43.480]   on this thing.
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.480]   Sure.
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.480]   Totally can do that.
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:51.400]   Can you just front the money, just a one-time payment, invest in the inn, and then we will
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:56.400]   continue the work in the mine?
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:57.400]   Okay.
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:58.400]   Right?
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.320]   We can explore the base for you.
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:01.320]   Yeah.
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:02.320]   It's like scribbling out some more.
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:06.880]   We can set up security measures for the portal.
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:07.880]   Yeah.
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:13.320]   And if you front the money for the inn, and staff the guards outside the mine, and ...
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:15.720]   We have to do that anyway, so that's a given.
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:16.720]   Yeah.
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:21.440]   And if you come up with anything else with the portal, we'd be happy to work it for you.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.040]   And we'll point that portal somewhere more benign.
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:25.040]   All right.
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:26.040]   Here's the terms I'll offer you.
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.040]   How much do you think you need for this inn?
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:32.040]   3,000.
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:33.040]   Yeah.
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:34.040]   That's right.
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:35.040]   I was thinking.
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:45.120]   I will loan you 3,000 based on your help.
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:50.600]   So as long as you are providing these services, I won't charge you any interest or expect
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:51.600]   repayment.
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:38:00.480]   At such time as we terminate that apportionment of the relationship, then the usual interest
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.280]   rates and payment plans will apply.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:05.480]   That's not good enough.
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:08.480]   What do you mean?
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:09.840]   Not good enough.
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:10.840]   What she said.
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:12.840]   Sorry.
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.600]   But we're going to need just an upfront, this is like your full investment.
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:18.600]   Okay.
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:20.560]   Well, it will have to be backed by something.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.560]   Yeah.
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:25.520]   We can take you down and show you hell.
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:32.400]   And maybe that would convince you to allow us to close it.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:33.400]   Yeah.
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:34.400]   He sits back.
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.760]   Oh, what about your import export business?
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:41.320]   We can start an import export business from other planes.
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:42.320]   Yes, yes.
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.320]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.320]   I don't know.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.320]   He's looking at it.
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:46.320]   That's the better reason.
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:47.320]   Oh.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:48.320]   That's it.
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:49.320]   It's only been a thousand someone years.
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:50.320]   Their cities fell from the sky, you know?
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:39:03.760]   They were so white and their hubris got them.
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:04.760]   Okay.
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:09.760]   I'm going to think about this.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.200]   I need $3,000, it's good.
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:20.000]   Yeah, but I can't, we can't do a loan.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000]   Okay.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:26.360]   What we've done for this guy, we can't be, I have a loan.
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:33.640]   But he can get a certain percentage of the, the ends income.
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:34.640]   Sure.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:35.640]   We could do that.
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:36.640]   How about this?
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:37.640]   Okay.
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:38.640]   Yeah.
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:39.640]   Sorry, sir.
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:40.640]   3000 down, 10%.
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:41.640]   10% interest?
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:42.640]   No, 10% profit.
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:50.920]   Oh, of the take?
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:51.920]   Yes.
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:58.080]   And any issues that arise with the hell portal, we will handle.
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:39:59.080]   Oh yeah.
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:00.080]   We'll handle the portal.
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:01.080]   We'll, and we'll continue exploring the netherese base for you.
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:02.080]   Do you have prior experience with hell?
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:03.080]   No, but we don't have prior experience with anything we do.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:04.080]   Look at us.
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:05.080]   Do you have prior experience with hell?
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:14.000]   No, but we don't have prior experience with anything we do.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000]   Look at us.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000]   Two weeks ago, I was just a bar.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000]   Now I have a magic trumpet.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000]   Sir, you wouldn't believe the things we've done.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000]   Trust me.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:20.000]   I'm going to need to consult with some other experts, but.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000]   Hey.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000]   How about this?
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000]   Where am I from?
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.000]   What town am I from?
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000]   Where's the other?
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000]   Well, who's my in-lady?
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000]   Oh, Fandlin.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000]   Fandlin.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000]   Fandlin.
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:37.560]   Where's the, where's the Fandlin?
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.560]   It's called.
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:39.560]   Griselda.
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:42.560]   Have you heard of the magical fort?
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:44.840]   Oh yeah, I just heard of it.
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:45.840]   Oh, you have.
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:46.840]   So we went there.
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:47.840]   We made friends with an owlbear.
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:48.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:52.440]   You two were involved with the incident, weren't you?
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.440]   No.
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:54.440]   No, but we survived it.
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:55.440]   Fandlin's the name of the town.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.440]   Fandlin.
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:57.440]   What town am I from?
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:58.440]   Fandlin.
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.440]   Fandlin.
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:01.440]   Okay.
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.680]   So, so you know about the, whatever it was that happened in the sword mountain a couple
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:06.680]   days ago.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:07.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:08.680]   Well, something's been happening, yeah.
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:09.680]   But you don't, you weren't involved.
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:10.680]   No, I'm just saying, been out there before.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:15.680]   The more you, the less you know, the better, sir.
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.880]   But we handled that situation.
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:21.640]   That's for people who invest in Inns to know.
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:22.640]   That's crazy.
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:23.640]   Does that make any sense?
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:33.060]   I need to figure out what his insights mean to find out about her.
[02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:34.260]   Insights based on wisdom.
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:35.260]   Bird.
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:36.260]   Yes.
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:37.260]   Bird.
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:38.260]   I'm just trying to tell me.
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.260]   Oh, poor him.
[02:41:39.260 --> 02:41:40.260]   Everybody's having a new character sheet in here.
[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:41.260]   He's probably pretty wise.
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:42.260]   I'll give him a plus two for wisdom and love.
[02:41:42.260 --> 02:41:43.260]   We're just getting into the chaos.

[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:25.760]   If the wrong people find out about this,
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.760]   they're going to try to do terrible things with it.
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:28.760]   Precisely.
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:31.760]   They're going to bring through the Illithids.
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:36.760]   They're going to tip the balance in various plainer wars.
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:40.760]   It could be really bad.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:43.760]   If somebody figured out the netherese tech
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:46.760]   and was able to open another one somewhere,
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.760]   then the cat's completely out of the bag.
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:54.760]   We're the only three people from now.
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:55.760]   That's good.
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:56.760]   And our crew.
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:46:57.760]   They don't really know what they did.
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:46:59.760]   They have no idea.
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:03.760]   They saw what happened, but they don't know what it means.
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:05.760]   Also, they're so low view.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:11.760]   It would take a really adverse event to put them off.
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:13.760]   Starting to get old.
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:18.760]   If you stabbed them in the back, they'd be like, "Ow! Why?"
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:22.760]   Just like I am when Milktea pokes me with her claw.
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.760]   "Ow, why?"
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:24.760]   Except I know why.
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:26.760]   It's because I'm not painting these things.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:27.760]   Look at that cat.
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:29.760]   He's so sacked out in that cardboard.
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760]   It's cool isn't it?
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.760]   And the reason she's there
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.760]   is because I put that box up there where she usually sits.
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:40.760]   That box has a scratching post in it
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:42.760]   that is to replace the damage they did in there.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:43.760]   Oh my gosh.
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:45.760]   They love to scratch.
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:49.760]   They hardly ever will destroy furniture if you give them something else.
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:53.760]   They do attack this chair, but I kind of encourage it
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:55.760]   because I think it's funny.
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:57.760]   I don't need to save the chair.
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:47:59.760]   And then I let them attack my bed too.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:02.760]   But I see that as just them doing their thing near me.
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.760]   It's because I'm there, not because of it.
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:05.760]   You know what I mean?
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:06.760]   Yeah, that's cute.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:08.760]   It is. It's so great. I love my cats.
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:16.760]   Anyway, so DeGault, so the deal with the nether...
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.760]   I don't have any leverage here really.
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:24.760]   You know more than I do
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.760]   and you seem to have mastery of this thing somehow.
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:34.760]   I'd like to bring in my own people to look at it, but...
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:35.760]   No.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.760]   No? All right.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:40.760]   I do want to see it though.
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:42.760]   Yeah, yeah. It's safe for you to see now.
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:43.760]   All right.
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:46.760]   We did turn off the brain scrambler.
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:47.760]   And we're pretty capable.
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:50.760]   If something happens, we can protect it.
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:51.760]   Yeah.
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:52.760]   You'd be surprised.
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.760]   Good.
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:57.760]   You'd be surprised who we can befriend.
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:03.760]   I don't know if you've heard of a giant vulture creature outside of town.
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:08.760]   Only the wolves know that.
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:12.760]   We were talking about a few days ago in the fields.
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.760]   Whatever we did.
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:16.760]   Yeah, only the wolves saw that.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:18.760]   There were no other witnesses.
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:21.760]   If they had been werewolves, then the bird might have gotten out.
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:23.760]   Werewolves.
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.760]   Werewolves do exist in this world, but they're not running any...
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:29.760]   as far as you know.
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:36.760]   Okay, yeah. Let's take a look. I guess...
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:42.760]   I'm not really in a position to ask for any kind of commitment from you,
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.760]   so you're just going to have to depend on your good will.
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:49.760]   But, you know, if things go awry,
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:53.760]   I will bring to bear what forces I do have to set things right.
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:56.760]   But I don't think I need to worry about that with you guys.
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:57.760]   Understood.
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:59.760]   Nah, we just want our end.
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:02.760]   I think that's great. That's a good sign.
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:07.760]   I see that as civic-minded, thinking of the future,
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:10.760]   like, community-oriented. That's really good.
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:14.760]   This town needs it. This town needs more businesses.
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:17.760]   I'm going to plant a little bit of roots here.
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:20.760]   That's fantastic. I'm so glad.
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:23.760]   Alright, let's go.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:26.760]   And he stands up and grabs his things.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:28.760]   He's got his sword.
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.760]   He's got...he grabs a shield.
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:37.760]   I'm going to say he's a fighter.
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:43.760]   And...actually, is he a fighter or would he be a soldier?
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:45.760]   One of the open ones.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:48.760]   Let's see if this thing says what he does.
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:50.760]   Just in case.
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:53.760]   No, it doesn't say anything, so that's fine.
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:55.760]   Okay, I can just make up whatever I want.
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:00.760]   Yeah, he's a fighter ousted from Waterdeep.
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:02.760]   Sounds interesting.
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:05.760]   I would like to ask him why he was ousted.
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:07.760]   He wouldn't know about that, I don't think.
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:09.760]   Well, you'd have to roll for it. Hold on.
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:12.760]   I wasn't supposed to tell him that.
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:17.760]   Hey, I heard you got kicked out of Waterdeep with that, though.
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:19.760]   Intoxicated in 12 weeks.
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:22.760]   Does this sound like lawful good behavior?
[02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:23.760]   What the hell?
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:25.760]   This must be a little too much to handle.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:27.760]   Unless it changes his tune.
[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:30.760]   Maybe that was his low point in life.
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:32.760]   Changed things around.
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:34.760]   What was this?
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:36.760]   Yeah.
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:38.760]   Oh, I see it.
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:40.760]   Wow.
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:45.760]   All right, well, anyway.
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:50.760]   Yeah, that's...secret scroll stuff.
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:56.760]   If you want to know more about him, you'll have to do research.
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:58.760]   Yeah, we'll take him through first.
[02:51:58.760 --> 02:52:00.760]   Show him the whole portal.
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:04.760]   Yeah, we'll at least show him that what we're talking about exists.
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:06.760]   Yeah, no, we're not.
[02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:07.760]   Just flip it.
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:12.760]   Oh, I just discovered this is the year...no, wait, 1492.
[02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:15.760]   Okay, three years ago was the year of the warrior princess.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:17.760]   I don't know what 1492 is.
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:18.760]   Distraction.
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:21.760]   All right.
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:27.760]   Actually, that is why I picked that year because it was easy for me to remember.
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:31.760]   1492, flown to sail the ocean's blue.
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:33.760]   Sail the planes of hell.
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:39.760]   Yeah, apparently there's planar sailing as a thing.
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:44.760]   It's called year of three ships sailing.
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:47.760]   Wow, that's an obvious reference.
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:49.760]   Are you in an actual ship?
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:50.760]   What's that?
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:53.760]   Like an actual boat when you go through the planes?
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:53:00.760]   No, I mean, you can do whatever you want, but...
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.760]   We need a flying boat.
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:05.760]   You would not be able to fit a boat through that hole right now.
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:09.760]   So, you make your way, are you going to bring your buddies or is it just going to be the three of you?
[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:11.760]   No, just the three of us.
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:12.760]   Okay.
[02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:19.760]   Well, can we bring them? If we need to change it all of a sudden, like you see some demon walking towards you.
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:20.760]   All right, buddies, come on.
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.760]   Oh.
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:22.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:25.760]   All right, so you take a little bit of time to round them up.
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:30.760]   Lord Neverembert makes note of them.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:32.760]   Can't take that back.
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:38.760]   And the six of you head up the hill, chomp, chomp, chomp.
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:46.760]   A few minutes later, you arrive at the site, the two guards, it's the next day, it's earlier in the day.
[02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:51.760]   What's-his-name-hasn't-started-your-shift, so they don't recognize you specifically, but they recognize him.
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:54.760]   And they're like standing up straight, out of tension.
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:56.760]   We're with this guy.
[02:53:56.760 --> 02:54:02.760]   And he just nods to them and they like back out of the way, move the ropes, everything.
[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:03.760]   Make way, make way.
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:08.760]   And as you pass, like a bit, you'll hear them like gossiping between them.
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:11.760]   What about the danger scene?
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:13.760]   You know, all that stuff.
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:22.760]   All right, and you continue chomp, chomp, chomping, and go down below with your three dudes and your lord.
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:26.760]   And you come to the hole, and there's no surprises.
[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:30.760]   Everything is as you left it, except the consoles are retracting again.
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:33.760]   Good thing we brought our friends.
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:36.760]   There you go. Good thinking.
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:40.760]   The port is stable.
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:46.760]   Oh, I forgot to pick which angle it's at relative to the hole.
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:49.760]   I'm going to say it's at a 45-degree angle relative to the hole.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:51.760]   The hole is in the middle of a wall.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:59.760]   So it's, well, not exactly in the middle of a wall, unlikely, but it's somewhere between the two corners of one of the walls.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:07.760]   And the plane is oriented corner to corner because that's where there's more room.
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:10.760]   It's harder to accidentally go through it if it's oriented that way.
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:12.760]   So that's the default.
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:18.760]   So he can see in and see right into the hellscape.
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:24.760]   So he comes around, he looks through the hole, and his eyes go wide.
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:36.760]   He involuntarily gasps, and instinctually reaches for his sword and realizes there's no enemy.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.760]   I see. Is it safe to go in there?
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:43.760]   Go in where? Hell or the room?
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:44.760]   The room.
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:45.760]   Oh, yeah, yeah, you can go in.
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:48.760]   Just don't go into hell, sir.
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:50.760]   And also don't walk over to the circle.
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:57.760]   Okay, so he carefully steps through the hole and sidles over the corner.
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:02.760]   He's staring through the portal, the trapezoid.
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.760]   Wow.
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:17.760]   And he's looking, you know, it's got that whole 3D thing with the parallax that, yeah.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:19.760]   How do you control it?
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.760]   All right, guys, that's your cue.
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.760]   Everybody pick a wall.
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:25.760]   In position.
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:29.760]   In position.
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:31.760]   And they're like, oh, okay.
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:32.760]   That's your cue.
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:40.760]   So the three of them go to their three corners, and all the displays flash,
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:47.760]   and the controls come out, and he's just wide-eyed like, how did you figure all this out?
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:50.760]   Oh, I read, read about it.
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:51.760]   That's incredible.
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:53.760]   Read the walls, read the writing on the walls.
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:57.760]   Wow.
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:03.760]   Okay, wow.
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:07.760]   Yeah, can we just point it somewhere?
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:09.760]   Do you know how to point it somewhere safer?
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:10.760]   No.
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:11.760]   Do we?
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:20.760]   Well, so all you know is, you know what the controls do, and you know, so you know how to go to any of the presets.
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:21.760]   Yeah.
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:29.760]   And you know that there are controls for dimensions in plane space and dimensions within a plane.
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:32.760]   That's why there's six different dimensions.
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:36.760]   So we could do it in our own, in our own plane.
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:38.760]   You would be running on battery power.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:41.760]   It wouldn't like have any strength.
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:46.760]   It probably wouldn't run for long, and if it ran out of power, you wouldn't be able to start up.
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:49.760]   So import/export is to different planes.
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:55.760]   But you could go other plane, and then from that plane back to this plane at a different location,
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.760]   if you can figure out how to build this machine.
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:57:58.760]   In the other place.
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:00.760]   Or somewhere else on this plane.
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:04.760]   So like if you build this machine again on the other side of the planet,
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:10.760]   you could go from here to hell, back to over there by having both of them pointing at the same location.
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:14.760]   In fact, you can even hand stuff across through the tool portals.
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:16.760]   That'd be cool.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:20.760]   Okay, so we can definitely set it on a different plane.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:22.760]   We just don't know where it's going to go.
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:25.760]   We'd have to figure out how to report where it's going to go.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:27.760]   So it's going to take some experimentation.
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:28.760]   Exactly.
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:29.760]   Yes.
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:32.760]   So let's maybe start with a different preset.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:35.760]   Do you need more help?
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:39.760]   Do you know people who specialize in portals?
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:43.760]   I have some planar specialists.
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:47.760]   I have trustworthy at that.
[02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:50.760]   Good people, men and women.
[02:58:50.760 --> 02:58:54.760]   We might need some help.
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:59.760]   I worry about what sorts of entities you might encounter by accident.
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:02.760]   Exactly.
[02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:12.760]   I can assemble for you a team to manage relatively small threats.
[02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:17.760]   And given the size of the portal, I think that might be enough.
[02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:19.760]   Okay.
[02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:24.760]   Although there are some very dangerous things that could fit through there.
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:28.760]   Yeah, give me, we'll need some time.
[02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:29.760]   Understandable.
[02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:31.760]   This is a lot to take in.
[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:40.760]   We would like to be the front people on this portal project of yours.
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:44.760]   So every hire would work directly under us.
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:45.760]   That's fine.
[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:46.760]   I think that makes sense.
[02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:48.760]   Do we have a good vibe for Nipperember, right?
[02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:51.760]   He's not going to turn evil or something like that.
[02:59:51.760 --> 02:59:53.760]   Oh yeah, your impression of him.
[02:59:53.760 --> 03:00:03.760]   I'll go ahead and give me an insight check and let me think about what his thing is.
[03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:10.760]   Oh, you can easily read him.
[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:13.760]   He's not quite sure what to make of you guys.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:18.760]   He's convinced that you're powerful based on your,
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:24.760]   he understands you just came to town and virtually instantly were able to figure this thing out.
[03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:27.760]   He doesn't know people like that.
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:30.760]   He thinks he knows people, he doesn't know you guys.
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:39.760]   So based on that alone, he's convinced that you guys are probably at least as equal if not more powerful than him.
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:44.760]   Which is interesting because he is more powerful in other contexts.
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:47.760]   He is a big player in the political scene.
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:58.760]   He's not a magic user, he's not a scholar, he's a businessman, he is a politician.
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:01.760]   Except he's one of the good ones, if there is such a thing.
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:04.760]   In this world there is such a thing as a good politician.
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:07.760]   They still have their problems of course.
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:11.760]   Anything can be taken too far, including lawful good.
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:28.760]   Chaos.
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:32.760]   I'll need a few days to gather a team.
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:39.760]   Be a team of I'm going to say five or six specialists.
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:43.760]   And then they'll just be at your command.
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:52.760]   Mostly protection and then some experts in the planes and in the netherese.
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:54.760]   Very good, very well.
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.760]   Maybe they can help us figure out what those other three planes are.
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:03.760]   I'll go ahead and ask Sarah to start construction at your inn.
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:05.760]   It should be done in a few weeks.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:09.760]   That's crazy.
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.760]   I imagine you saying that.
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:15.760]   I know you're not saying that out loud, but I think that's hilarious.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.760]   Small bean and bird high fives.
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:20.760]   Show them high fives.
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:21.760]   Yeah.
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:30.760]   Sorry sir.
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:33.760]   We've got to find a bird now.
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:35.760]   Oh, I know where I can look.
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:51.760]   Just a moment.
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:56.760]   Song beans.
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:06.760]   I had meant for Never Ember's arrival to be a cliffhanger, and then it happened so early.
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:35.760]   You have done all of the things except for one of the things that I had as triggers for ending the session.
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:45.760]   You figure out how to operate it, you decide to start your inn for sure, and you've got Never Ember here in town.
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:50.760]   So your cliffhanger is just what's going to happen next, who knows?
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:51.760]   I love it.
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:52.760]   I'm excited.
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:53.760]   Perfect.
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:56.760]   You've still got 30 minutes more to play if you want.
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:59.760]   I think it's a pretty good spot to end.
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:08.760]   We basically got the inn, we get access to a team, we get to explore the base.
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:13.760]   Now we can think about what the heck we want to do.
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:17.760]   We can explore the base while he gets the team ready.
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:18.760]   Yeah.
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:19.760]   That's true.
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:21.760]   The inn's going to take a few weeks.
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:24.760]   The inn's going to take a while, the base is going to take a while.
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:33.760]   Yeah, in six weeks, the base, you don't know how big it is, I don't know anything about the base at all.
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:37.760]   I haven't made that up yet, and none of this part is pulled from Cup Cannon.
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:39.760]   This is all clouded in me.
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:40.760]   I love it.
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:42.760]   You're exploring my imagination.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:43.760]   Nice.
[03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:44.760]   It's already in there.
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:49.760]   It's basically an amalgamation of your brain and our brains.
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:50.760]   That's true.
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:55.760]   Throw in a blunder and speed six.
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:56.760]   What?
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.760]   Speed six.
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:00.760]   Throw in a blunder, speed six.
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:01.760]   That's good.
[03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:02.760]   That's fun.
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:03.760]   That was good.
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:04.760]   Yes.
[03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:05.760]   Well done.
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:06.760]   Holy cow.
[03:05:06.760 --> 03:05:07.760]   That was a great session.
[03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:08.760]   Yeah.
[03:05:08.760 --> 03:05:11.760]   You're business people, you've made great connections.
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:15.760]   This town, right now, their disposition towards you is very positive.
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:18.760]   They're looking up to you, they trust you.
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:21.760]   Those are the ones who saved us from that thing.
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:24.760]   We told Sarah that she wouldn't listen.
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:27.760]   Listen, I know we might have ruined everything by activating the mountain.
[03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:30.760]   Yeah, the Lord might end you because of us.
[03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:33.760]   Yeah, well, nobody knows except you.
[03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:36.760]   We should really reposition.
[03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:40.760]   How do we close the portal without deactivating it?
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:41.760]   Is that a thing?
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:42.760]   Can we...
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:51.760]   It has to be pointed somewhere to keep its batteries going.
[03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:52.760]   Okay.
[03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:53.760]   Because like...
[03:05:53.760 --> 03:05:55.760]   Where it's pointed, there are infinite planes.
[03:05:55.760 --> 03:06:01.760]   Is the mountain also affecting other planes because there's now a portal?
[03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:07.760]   Oh yeah, is the mountain connected to the portal at all?
[03:06:07.760 --> 03:06:10.760]   Or is it just separate?
[03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:12.760]   I have things to think about.
[03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:13.760]   You know what I mean.
[03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:15.760]   You'll have to investigate to find out.
[03:06:15.760 --> 03:06:19.760]   You do have very limited communication with the mountain through Carmel.
[03:06:19.760 --> 03:06:20.760]   Yeah.
[03:06:20.760 --> 03:06:26.760]   You can give commands and receive updates.
[03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:31.760]   And the mountain does have cameras, but it's not super smart.
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:36.760]   It's not a Claude AI level of smartness.
[03:06:36.760 --> 03:06:41.760]   It's more like a regular computer.
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:43.760]   Slightly smarter than that, right?
[03:06:43.760 --> 03:06:45.760]   You can teleport, right?
[03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:47.760]   About 30 feet.
[03:06:47.760 --> 03:07:01.760]   The spell to teleport that far is sixth level, I think, and has a 5% chance to go very wrong.
[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:08.760]   Unless you have a teleportation circle, in which case I think there's a lower level spell and it's reliable.
[03:07:08.760 --> 03:07:12.760]   It works a little bit like the portal, except it's not across planes.
[03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:18.760]   Oh, it can be across planes, but it doesn't have to.
[03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:23.760]   And that's a thing that you can find in D&D Beyond.
[03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:28.760]   Anything in D&D Beyond is real here.
[03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:34.760]   So if you guys find a spell that you like or some story that you like or something,
[03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:39.760]   if you hear about a god that you think sounds terrible or awesome and you want to interact with them in some way,
[03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:45.760]   that is a thing that if you can explain how your character came into that disposition, then that's a thing.
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:47.760]   But right now you've got plenty going on.
[03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:49.760]   Yeah, there's a lot going on.
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:53.760]   So much. Oh my goodness.
[03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:55.760]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:58.760]   This is why two weeks is better now.
[03:07:58.760 --> 03:08:00.760]   Yeah, you were right.
[03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:03.760]   I was almost ready to put today off.
[03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:05.760]   Like earlier today, I'm like, am I ready?
[03:08:05.760 --> 03:08:06.760]   You were ready.
[03:08:06.760 --> 03:08:07.760]   Oh yeah.
[03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:08.760]   I was ready.
[03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:09.760]   You were so ready.
[03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:10.760]   Thank you.
[03:08:10.760 --> 03:08:11.760]   Yeah.
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:12.760]   You got here.
[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:14.760]   Also, you can only be so ready because it's like--
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:15.760]   That's true.
[03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:16.760]   There's no way I know what you're going to do.
[03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:20.760]   It's this freaking left field of like, I don't know where for a lot of stuff.
[03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:23.760]   You turned yourselves into a totem pole last session.
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:24.760]   Yeah.
[03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:26.760]   There's no way of knowing what kind of ridiculous thing you're going to do.
[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:28.760]   That's just the beginning.
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:31.760]   I don't have any illusions of thinking I have control.
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:33.760]   We got a job at the Inn.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:34.760]   Yeah, I got it.
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:35.760]   Yeah.
[03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:36.760]   And then we got an Inn.
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:37.760]   Yeah.
[03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:39.760]   Galeo's going to be so happy for you guys.
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:40.760]   Yes.
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:45.760]   He'll offer all of his expertise on getting set up and things like that.
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:48.760]   He'll get you connected with suppliers and stuff.
[03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:49.760]   What's the name of the Inn going to be?
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:51.760]   Oh, you've got to think that up.
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:52.760]   The birds and the beans.
[03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:53.760]   Bean birds.
[03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:54.760]   Oh my gosh.
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:55.760]   The birds and the beans.
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:56.760]   Yeah, actually.
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:58.760]   You don't remember talking about the birds and the beans?
[03:08:58.760 --> 03:08:59.760]   The birds and the beans.
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:00.760]   That's amazing.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:01.760]   Sit on down.
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:04.760]   Let me tell you about the birds and the beans.
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:05.760]   That's perfect.
[03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:07.760]   I guess, yeah, the bird and the bean.
[03:09:07.760 --> 03:09:08.760]   Yeah.
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:09.760]   Or what did I say?
[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:11.760]   The song beans or the...
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:12.760]   Bean birds or something?
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:13.760]   No.
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:15.760]   It was song beans or bird...
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:16.760]   No.
[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:17.760]   Small birds.
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:18.760]   Small birds.
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:19.760]   For like our guild.
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:20.760]   Bean song.
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:21.760]   Or our clan.
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.760]   Oh, yeah.
[03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:24.760]   Song beans.
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:25.760]   The song beans.
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:26.760]   Yeah.
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:27.760]   The birds, the small birds.
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:28.760]   Song beans.
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:29.760]   Song beans.
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:30.760]   Birds and the beans is a pretty funny inn.
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:31.760]   I love that.
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:32.760]   No tea is skeptical of all of your plans.
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:33.760]   She's like, "Really?"
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:34.760]   She's like, "Yeah."
[03:09:34.760 --> 03:09:35.760]   She's a very interactive cat right now.
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:36.760]   Meow.
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:37.760]   Meow.
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:38.760]   Meow.
[03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:53.280]   She's cute.
[03:09:53.280 --> 03:09:56.280]   She is the most interactive out of all three cats.
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:57.280]   Where's the other one?
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:09:58.280]   No idea.
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:09:59.280]   Jax is probably up there and Whiskey fell into the bed.
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:00.280]   Who?
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:01.280]   Is Jax up there?
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:02.280]   Let's see.
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:03.280]   No.
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:04.280]   He's not.
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:05.280]   Oh, I guess he's hiding.
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:06.280]   That's unlike him.
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:07.280]   Well, it's just you two...
[03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:09.280]   Milti's the bravest of the three of them.
[03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:10.280]   I know.
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:13.280]   Even though she's almost the lightest of the three of them.
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:14.280]   She and Whiskey are close to...
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:15.280]   Oh, no.
[03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:16.280]   She is the lightest.
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:17.280]   That's right.
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:18.280]   Whiskey's a little heavier than that.
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:19.280]   Do you want the last piece?
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:20.280]   Sure.
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:21.280]   Do you want a slice?
[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:22.280]   No.
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:23.280]   We can take the box if you just want to grab the slice.
[03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:24.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:25.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:26.280]   I'll just eat it right after you guys go.
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:27.280]   Okay.
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:28.280]   But, yeah.
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:29.280]   Do you want us to take the box?
[03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:30.280]   Sure.
[03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:31.280]   Since you're offering.
[03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:32.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:39.280]   Just put that on the plate and I'll do it.
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:43.280]   Oh, there's an unbeatable one.
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:44.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:45.280]   There you go.
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:46.280]   Cool.
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:47.280]   Oh, awesome.
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:48.280]   Mm-hmm.
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:49.280]   Good work, everybody.
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:50.280]   That was good.
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:51.280]   Wow.
[03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:52.280]   That was fun.
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:53.280]   That was fun.
[03:10:53.280 --> 03:10:54.280]   That was a lot of good moments.
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:55.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:56.280]   Yeah.
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:57.280]   Wow.
[03:10:57.280 --> 03:10:58.280]   Thanks.
[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:03.280]   Every single time you guys blow my mind.
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:04.280]   All righty.
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:05.280]   Thanks so much.
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:06.280]   Thank you.
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:07.280]   You guys are great.
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:08.280]   What was the code again?
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:09.280]   Like one.
[03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:10.280]   4040.
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:11.280]   Oh, never mind.
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:12.280]   Not one.
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:13.280]   4040.
[03:11:13.280 --> 03:11:14.280]   4040.
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:15.280]   All right.
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:16.280]   Thank you.
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:17.280]   Until next time.
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:18.280]   Have a good drive.
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:19.280]   Have a good night.
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:20.280]   Come up with your in-guild names.
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:21.280]   And I'll see you in a couple weeks.
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:22.280]   Yeah.
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:23.280]   Thank you.
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:24.280]   Bye.
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:24.280]   Bye.
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:33.280]   That was great.
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:36.280]   Now, let's pause this.
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:37.280]   Yeah.
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:38.280]   Goodness.
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:38.280]   That was fun.
