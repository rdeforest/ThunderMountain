. What is going on here? Don't stop. We're back to recording. We're back to recording. For real this time. Okay, it's not stopping now. That's good. Let me see what happens when it gets to the end of this bar here. Should just extend the bar, hopefully. And it's just going, okay, good. Man, I have been having just the last couple of days, stuff has just not been. I mean, nothing bad, just stuff has been just not working, right? Like, my computer now, I made the mistake of rebooting it, and now I have no desktop. No. I mean, I can get to the console just fine, but, well, technically, this is kind of a diversion, but it's all right. We've got time. It's 35.. It It was kind of starting, and then the window manager wasn't working. So I decided to upgrade everything, and then it wouldn't start at all. So now. Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're living life on the bleeding edge. I'm using the unstable version while testing version of the distribution I'm using. I'm one of those. It's like. You know, those people that have a car that's it's going to be working any minute now. It mostly works, mostly. I just need this one part from China. It's going to be here in a few days. I'm going to stall. Everything's going to be fine. And as he's.. Sure. Happy to. All right, back to. Oh, yeah, I was going to look over here at stat blocks. Okay. Clan, I don't think this is going to pose a challenge to them. This is ridic. I don't think Claude knows how to roll up encounters. I'm going to have to make some adjustments. Um, this is gonna be. Wait a minute, 5 D. Oh, I see. Uh...? No, they are pure magic. They're elementals. So, an elemental, like, you'd probably be familiar with a an earth elemental is basically a gollm. It's just this thing that it's all dirt and it walks around and it smashes stuff. It's like the Incredible Hulk. Or no, the Hulk's buddy, the guy that's made a stone. Fire Elementals wander around and start fires. This is. This is pure This is a thunder elemental. It is the element of thunder. Is that what it looks like? Oh, let me see. Yeah, yeah, sure, exactly. So. elemental It's kind of like a little ink Yeah, yeah, it's like an imp. It's like a little element. Now, the ones that you're seeing on the display are not fully opaque. You can kind of see through them because they are elements of sound.. So that's one way to go. You also have the maintenance shaft, which all you see is just, it's got like three different cameras and none of them show any of the monsters. I need to make sure that I have stats for that too. Anything that you don't defeat on your way out will be stronger when you come back. We're going to have to go there at some point. So it doesn't really matter that much. You're not going to miss out on anything by picking one way or the other. You're still going to end up fighting all of these things. It's just when you come back, they'll have grown to still be a challenge to you. Would you eat my ass Ray, what is that room with you get out of that room? Yeah, what you get out of it or how you get out of it? I know we need to clear it because we need to clear everything, but is there any importance to that room specifically? It's a great question, and I don't remember. I think the answer is there is and the significance that he will tell you about is it helps the facility, maybe has g We should go to the ring that is gonna benefit a facility in us the most. Yeah. I agree. Um. Interesting idea.. Huh? What's up? if you working.. Here we go. Um. Hmm. Ray says he is not aware of any particular, uh, like, treasure or anything waiting there, but the whole facility is a place of science and learning and there are there's always something to be gained from any interaction with the the various parts of the mountain, that it's. Oh, go ahead. You had said that that room specifically is one of rooms that you can't. The one that can't be cleared is the maintenance shaft. That's the one that doesn't show you what's waiting for you there. You can get there. There are two options, right? You have three options. Okay. So I'll redescribe the three options. Three options are the way you came. Oh, and looking at that, it reports that there's been a geological activity. There's been a landslide that closed off the side that went towards the Albers. You'll remember that when you came in one way was the Albert way, and the other way was the bullet way, and you went the bullet way and snuck past, and it was really cool. The way that that you would have gone back out, the Albert Way is now closed off from the mountain, like rejiguring itself. healing its wounds and such, has caused rocks to come tumbling down. And hopefully no olbares were hurt. But you can still go the other way past the bullets, which you see on the displays are actively being fought by the modrons.. And it looks like it's going to take a while for them. We all meet there. We need food in a day, but You've got time. There's nothing else pressing that you know of. You don't know of anything, any negative consequences of taking your time. So if we don't go to the front, we'll let them fight the wolves. That'll take a week, the system says. What's going on with the dogs? Dogs? You. Well, I'm shaking my. I'm like yeah. I'm shaking my feet because I'm full of caffeine and I've got ADHD. What's up? What do you want? So the three. the other two are the maintenance shaft and the the resonance chamber. The maintaft we don't know which kind of exciting because we don't know. There's definitely something there. Yeah. And then the other one, we don't know we're probably going to have to fight. We're do something with these elementals. But we can see it. So if we go there, we at least kind of note what we're getting into. You also know from small beans Archanak, that the methits are inclined to stay in that room. You can approach them and they won't come out and get you. They're just keeping you from going through. And the system says there's an emergency exit, but it's blocked by the sounds that are currently going on in that chamber. The emergency exit has an unlocked condition that it won't unlock while there's sound going on because they didn't want to release dissonance out through the exit. I'm fine going either way, I say I like to. Pure chaos. I've done that to the cats, too. No, Chick, Chickens. Chickens. Oh, boy, you under. Do you want to go to the methit room or do you want to go down the shop? Um, I want the method room. Okay. Does that Yeah, I have I want to see if I can somehow canvince a method to be my hour. Do you? If it's not possible, it's not hospital, but I want to play the trumpet if it's attracted to the dissonance. Oh, yeah, I. Right. And it's I play a trumpet. What this guy trying not to fight anything ever? I thought you were a police officer.vinced one to like, hey, you will have a life of me playing dissonance and you can follow me and be a trickster. You can do all that together, like see if I could persuade it. in it not will kill it. are we gonna kill it There's always a way. Do you guys have magic weapons now, so. It's D&D. You can always beat stuff to death. Ray doesn't know anything about methods. Ray. Up until Ray's death, Ray was just an engineer until his death, and then he became With, and he doesn't understand Wraithness either. Before we go to Matt Room, can we do a history check to earn all on? Yes, I love. I know. I need to do some research on method, too. I. You've forgotten everything you ever did know? Yeah. Okay. I have to look up.. You say you roll a two? Oh, okay. When you roll a two, you got to say shout out to the two crew. It's a reference. That's it. So, let's see here. Let's look at a smoke method, I guess. 2024 or smoke method 24 go. Cat talks. Um. So, what did you get on yours? 13? Okay. Um.. They can sometimes be negotiated with. They. No. I don't even know what they Oh, they speak primordial. I don't think any of you have primordial. Do either of you have a linguistic thing? There's a There's a spell that does lets you talk to people that you don't speak the same language of. Yeah, I don't have. Okay. Okay. Let me see what I have in my notes here about them. Go ahead and close that tab and we'll close that too. Yeah, I think Claude forgot that methods don't speak common. However, you had something in common with them in that you understand the language of acoustics and of magical resonance between the two of you.. Those work doesn't that's right anything about language. I think you're right that you can use message. Let me look at that real quick. Let's see, spells message, yes. You point towards the creature within range, and whisper a message, the target here's the message and can reply. solid objects. Yeah, it doesn't say whether you have to know the language or not. I'm going to say that you are able to communicate. with the smartest method. that cool?. Yeah. So, yeah, you historically discerned, you remember hearing stories of people speaking with supernatural creatures like this through message. And yeah. All right. The chamber is not on your map because. Um. I'll top of my head, I don't know. Uh, I think they might like it, because they're Thunder Elementals. It would be like feeding them. Yeah. It does damage... No, I wouldn't do damage to them. It would strengthen them. It would be like healing. No. They might like the trumpet. because, you know, more energy and it's a little bit magical. So it's. I think if the two of you put on a magic and sound display that they would probably like that. I feel like Claude is favoring Kyle for some reason. All right, well, it's just weirding me out because I'm like,Is this a gender bias thing? Like, is it. narrow? It does. It knows that you're my niece. Like, I told it. You're my niece, so it knows you're a woman, and this is so weird. Anyway. I feel like the last time. Well, I went out of my way to make sure that you got enough attention last time. That was. But now when I've let him him, when I've let Claude do its own thing, it's Anyway, whatever. He's? Yeah. I want I do want to see if you can charm with. Well, I do that my animal handling when I leveled up, which I because I want a pet eventually, because I want like a little fal or something. Aw. But I don't know when we're going to go outside. Thundermeph would be a pretty poor choice. They're kind of evil. The Mephhets in general tend to be evil. They are tricksters.? What? I think a fifth level spelled, you can bind it. There's that elemental binding? Yeah, call it. Yeah.. They hate that, but you can still do it. Yeah. But you can still do it. I have All right. All right.. Let's fight him. You it reminds me of the little thing at Hercules, not the chubby one, but the other one. Oh, yeah. But like elemental. Yeah. Like the skinny, like little. I'm not going to bother with a map on this one. What the hell? Um, more sound, Destructive interference. So if you can match their sound, let me look at your spells, too, because that's a really good point. I have a lot of spells Hmm. Let's take a look at that.. Oh, yeah, Psychic damage for sure. Oh. Wait, yeah. Acid cold fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. I would say. Not now. Um, I think cold would mess them up because it would change the frequencies of the resonant frequency of the air. No, have a psychic damage. It would. And it would absorb the energy that they're feeding off of. And also, well, you're smart. You would figure out that if you can disrupt the shape of the room and make it less appealing to them, or if you can make the room absorb all of its current waves. It's getting fed by the mountain, but if you can make it absorb it instead of bouncing it, then the methods will be like,. All right, so. All right. Cool. This is midway through. We're at the halfway point of the time. Do you guys need a biio break or anything? A little bit. Okay, cool. I'll always have to check.. You're welcome. And it's partly for my sake to make sure that I remember I have an hour and a half to make the cliffhanger happen.. Okay. So you make your way following the blue trace that you've told the computer to light up more brightly than the others for you to take you to the chamber. You seat at the end of a hall. So there's. There's a door. inside of that door, there's a control room, and then there's another door into the chamber itself. The control room has. It is currently somewhat damaged, but the display is working and showing the currently playing or resonating waveforms. It's giving you a. This is so sci-fi instead of fantasy, but it's fine. It's giving you rotating 3D view of the room showing the standing waves that are currently You just want to play with us, don't you? I know you do. Wow. Yeah, does every time, right when he gets good. It's true. He's king off of your guys' excitement. empow the meth is what he's. That's right. He bones. And he's like, fuck your. Thunder noises.. Yeah, Not for de, but we have to fight.. Oh, he's so happy. Okay. Uh, yeah, so the as you get closer, you can now see that up above, there's one that's a little bit larger than the rest, and it seems to be watching you intelligently. It is sitting at the most energetic point that can be sat at. Like, there's energetic points in, or nodes, I should say, not points. There's there's the nodes that are nothing, and then there's the part. And the methods are favoring the areas that have more energy in them. They're like cats basking in the sun, but instead, they're basking in the noise. But yeah, the one up top is on top of one of the dishes and because of the way the dishes are all turned, somehow a big chunk of this stuff is pointed at it. it's a little weird that it got arranged like this because it's. There's three pedestals that stuff's supposed to get put on, and there's no energy getting directed towards those at all. You rolled well on your method roll earlier. They must have bumped them around to make them more comfortable for themselves. They've made the room as unpleasant for anybody else as they can and pleasant for them. And they're quite pleased with themselves. So, yeah, there's three hanging out, down below and one up above that's a little bit larger, and a little bit smarter. And you've got the controls in there, but they're broken, and you can see where the waves are, and you have your ingenuity, and I think you guys were planning just go in and wreck face. All right. Do you want to do any planning or just have that on? send a message to it and I take my. It'll go through. wall. Yeah, it'll go through the windows that are.. I want to negotiate the smart one? All right, what do you want to say?. Well, the only problem with that is that we do that we lose Elvis. Um. Did you sneak into the control room? Or have you gotten into the control room yet? Because you can see the control room from the outside. You can like peek through the door and stuff. You currently have the element of surprise if you want it. Whether you'll be able to maintain it when you get in there. You probably don't.. There's, what, four? There's four. Three smaller ones, one bigger one. Yeah, how we want to do this one, because there's this is a bigger fight, right? Kind of. Yeah. Hopefully, it's supposed to be. This should be hard if. We still have. Well, I roll. Did Ray help in the last battle? I don't remember. Oh, he did, didn't he? He had a death touch or something. Yeah, yeah, or something like. That was probably another reason why that fight was too easy is because I didn't take Ray into account. Oh. But, like, not?? No, no, I have magic. I didn't hit all of them. You can hit three of them. or you can hit one three times. But you know what our in That's true, too.. It's happened before? All. in my orb. So the door slightly cracked? Do we. What if we test their capabilities by silight imaging the automatron in the center of the room to see if they attack more? Sure.. That way, they all zap if they zap in. That won't even start initiative unless they decide to attack it and even then, you won't be right there. Yeah, so I see You're going to go ahead and do that? Yeah. Let me just, that'ow. Y... Okay. Yeah, I'll cast silent image of whatever the normal size. Like a medium one? Medium, yeah, just identical to what would be in the facility that they would normally see. Okay. And I' passed it somewhere in the middle where they can all see it. Okay. The three below sitting in their perches go. and look at it. and cock their ears and put their wings out to feel if it's making any noises and it's not. They look confused. The one up above looks at you. Looks at him? Yeah. It doesn't do anything, though. They're just hanging out. I don't like this.? Yeah, I'm not. Should try to message it? Should I see if we don't lock the following? It's not, I'm gonna go ahead and tell you, because of her high role. It's not gonna want to follow you. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Well, and they want to stay in this road. Very likely. As long as it's so comfortable for them, they will.. If you want. Is it a dead in room or is there There's an exit. There's an emergency exit, which is currently disabled because there are noises going. There's a lot of noise going on in the room. You can't hear the noise right now because the door is closed. A lot of noise in Yeah, in the chamber. Okay. The spal, mostly spherical chamber with absorption panels on the outside, but all these reflective surfaces that are that can be moved around and stuff. Yeah. We're going to happen to move the dishes around, I think we've got we've got a place. You're too smart.. Is this game two? You think this is a game? I' world. Yeah. You know I imagine dishes mean something that you put them back in order. I also wonder if we messed up the flow of the room, the sounds, if I was wondering if I to spell that took sound away. There is, there is as well. goodness the sound away, would they like not want to be there? It was like a tiny hood. sub? Mm. See if they' they're like. Oh, are these times they're kind of evil, right? They candy. They tend more on the evil side, but they're not necessarily just because something's evil, just because it's malicious doesn't mean it's not lazy. I probably like that. Yeah? It depends on how you play it. It's up to you. You can you have the choice as a musician to entertain or to horrify or something else, whatever you want. You're doing the perception? Okay. And what are you trying to perceive?. Okay, what? Oh, that would be insight 'cause you're trying to guess their disposition. Yeah, that's what I was. Okay, go ahead. And let's see. Well, I'll just decide. 19 Wow, they are curious. They are comfortable, they don't find you at the moment threatening. They haven't seen anything moving inside the facility other than the modons for a long time. But. the one up top is smart enough to know that the image wasn't real because it didn't make any noise. But also because it wasn't real, it knew that it was something that you guys had done and it looked at handsome guy. The songbird, because there's a somatic hand waving component to the spells used, I think. Yeah, you can infer that from the scenario from what you've seen peeking through the door, you can gather that the dishes are not in the way that they would normally be, and that you can see marks on them from them having been scrbled at by tiny claws and stuff. Well, not that tiny, but claws. they not? If you can make them better, they'd like that. And, oh, and since you can see the display and you read Dorvan, you know that the emergency exit is only blocked because there's sound on it and you could take the sound off of it by adjusting the room and still have their B sound in the room for the methods to enjoy. Yeah. So they currently are not hostile at all. They have no reason to be. They don't they are comfortable. They're basically like well fed. They're Imagine lions that have just totally destroyed a wildebeest, flock. I don't know, what do you call it, herd. A herd a wildebeest have been completely destroyed by a bunch of lions. Now they're laying around with their bellies exposed, going, "Oh, so good being in the savannah with the sun shining and a belly full of meat." Yeah, babe, you your little trumpet? I You were gonna message it first, right? Yeah, or one question is the exit is there. We got the exit working. Does it close again if we and does it go to outside? You've got all that from the computer. I think we So what do we have to do to get the exit open? Just make it so that the sounds are not focusing energy on it. It's so the mechanism that keeps it from opening is a protection from having the sound escape through the shaft and cause problems outside of the facility. and I step outside and my trunk, they follow me out and then I just. You know what I mean? Well, I don't know. We just blow up, too. I'm saying. I would say that's always an option. There's an exit right there. I don't like that I. I don't like this. Yeah. Can you find it? I don't know where it is. But you need to tell me what we're going to do. Since you guys have been taking your time, I'm going to say you've had enough time to watch them, their body language and stuff. You've seen them get bored with the illusion. The one at top, since you've been able to compare it to the others, it's probably older. Yeah. Like, maybe the parent of the others or maybe just an older one that they're following around or something. We haven't been attacked yet, right? So They don't look like they want to. Let's just move around.. There's a lot of stuff. What is it at least? What? Yeah. Okay. So then?. This is what happens only randomly by other bunch of me. You down smaller ones. Yeah, it's definitely something I will never do. That's that? there. Nate. Oh, come here. You eat this and shut. Peach, please., you get this one. Aw. Peppers. No, b. Do you still have some of that lemon iced tea? Yeah. Awesome. I would like some of that.. Yeah, no problem. All right, and I can get one forka? Yeah. Burka. cheese, honey. Here go. Is it like, those are? No, I know.. I' get to. They're not. I. Hey. Come on, baby. Perfect. Look at your phone. Do you want it over there? Yeah. And Yes, please. All right, I don milk. Okay. You said you wanted to send a message. Well, that was when I was gonna try to train it. I don't think I want to be able to train it. So let's just start putting this stuff together and do it turn up. Let's. Okay. So we're gonna go in. and you know what? Come up with some react. Can we come up with like react spells, like if they do this and you do that? Yeah, preparing action? Yeah.. Before you gone into initiative, you can prepare an action that will go off, even before you come up in the initiative if the initiative turns out that way, yes. Okay. So you can decide to be like, all right, you do such and such, and I'll have an action ready to do blah blah. Okay.. What are you guys gonna do? My preaction. Prepared action? Prepared action will be. I'll cast mirror image. That way, there's going to be. Yeah. Four more of you? Three? plus me. Yeah. Okay, Four total. That's right. I remember. that way they'll have to figure out who's. It's not even figuring out. They just have to actually hit any of them and then they disappear. If they're not you. They might be you. We'll take up at least. Yeah. two of them a fake. Yup. That's right. Serafina will.. Sure hang back, I guess. Let's see. Where's her actions? Oh, uh, oh, she's got guidance. How does that work?. Until the spell and. Oh, it's concentration.. Oh, my God. That's delightful. I love it.. Well, that's for ability checks, that's no good. I don't care about that. Uh. Divine smite. That sounds good. How does that work? Oh, she'll cast. Here we go. Before the action starts, she will cast. Lasts up to 10 minutes. Oh, but it's concentration, so it has to be. What's the range? Okay, until the spell ends, one willing creature. Okay. Um. I also like to prepare for Cla. Okay. That sounds good. Full damage, because he said so? Yeah.? No, but like, I'm sorry, what? 38? I think. Plus something. So. Ser Athena is going to cast protection from evil on herself, and she says, I'll go in first if we need to. Because she is your tank, actually. Yeah. Oh, I see you rolled some damage already. That's good. I'll keep that in mind. I told me. He popped up on my screen. Yeah. That's great. Oh, it's roll on here. It did. It did just now, yeah. So roll. That's cool. embar inspiration. Not a bad idea. Yeah. I can give two things at this. You haven't started anything yet, so as long as you're not worried about using up time, how long your bariration lasts indefinitely. So I was use it since last time. Well, she slept since last time, so.. All right, yeah, I'll ask Morgan inspiration on you. And instead of doing. year inage, I'll do a guiding bowl at big guy. Iss a big guy? Yeah. You still haven't signed a message, right? No. Okay.. Oh, okay. So after sending the message, you would prepare your action. So that's going to be, can you do that? I think you can either prepare the action or initiate. Well, actually, the message isn't going to initiate anything, so you can just send the message. And they can reply, right? And they can reply. They get a short reply. Should I just tell it? But it could draw agro depending on what you say. Hi. And you can use your persuasion or performance or your intimidation or, yeah, any of any of those three to impart your intent into this message. I see, what's your let me look at your skills here. Yeah, it's like 25 words or something. That's the usual amount, I think. You've got plus five to persuasion. I want to convince it to allow us as the owners the facility to fix the room and let them out through the exit because I heard there's better sounds out there. Not necessarily better sounds out there. What I was saying was that the they're here because these are the best sounds and quite some that they've heard in quite some time. They came from other planes. The plain of sound, they got tired of from hanging out too long and they decided to check out the material plane and this place drew them like flies. So we're fixing.. And they could leave anytime they want. Okay. If they wanted to leave, they would have. What you can fix is, well, you would actually be undoing what they had done if you were to fix the room. Right. And eventually, it will get fixed because this facility is back online, and it's prioritizing the exterior first for defensive purposes reclaiming the area that it considers its own, the facility kind of has a sense of identity. It's entirely mechanical, but it's sufficiently complex to have a kind of a spirit of its own. You would have gleamed that from interacting with it at the console. I don't recommend that.'re not in that loud. Man, that that's one way to piss off a Thunder method. You're not Do you even make noise, bro? I can't even hear you. Well, none of them are trying to make noise right now. They're just chilling. They're Yeah. Imagine cats, as I said before. with the Where do you think? She's thinking. It's Oh, my goodness. What do you do? off a piece of bone and I wasn't sure if it was too thin, but. I' Sorry. What' asking me? How are you guys out? Okay, well, say that? What happened? Okay, so Small says, let's freeze these guys. All right. So then Serafina will just wait by the door and then she'll look at you and be like, are you ready? Looking at Smallbean? And you nod, and then she'll open the door, and then we'll roll in a shift. Oh, actually, that doesn't start initiative, because nobody's attacked anybody yet.. She opens the door, and nothing happens. They don't do anything. The big one goes. That's it. West do you want me to say? What's up? I let me have some more. The zoo. Is Zoo wearing a hat? Is that what you said? It'sion. Is it wearing a hat? I'm just going to message the big one and say, we're with the facility. We're cleaning this room. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't interfere. Ah, okay. Now we're talking. It will respond in your head very loudly. It's going to hurt. And it says, "We like the boom boom room!" Um. And you can.. Okay, go for it. I'm going to banging ball at the biggest. That will start initiative. Here we go. At this point, we're going to move in. You have been messing around a lot. Okay. They are on. I'm just going to take that as is. They don't get a bonus. I need to bring up my notes. Oh,. Jesus. You guys get to go first. I haven't rolled for Serfina or Tuneic yet, but the Mephods are all going on 16.. Roll. Oops. VI. So, methods on 16 songbird on 20. What did you get again, thunder? for small be. And then Sina is on. Oh, goodness. She's rolling well, too. She's on 21. Which is good 'cause she's right up from oh, no, she doesn't want to run up ahead because you're going to cast a thing that does. It does area effect, right? Or is it hit a specific, do you remember? I look, I just look at your thing. Yours. Mine? Like your chromatic orb.. It does. Oh, okay, good. Then she's fine. And you were going to do guiding bol. Okay. So she's going, yeah, when it comes, when I get around to actually finishing writing all this stuff up, Sarahfina, she's going to go first. Sarah goes on 21 and then.ic the goblin. Rolls poorly.. Well, I'm on the website, so it looks different for me. No On mine it's next to armor classroom. Okay, so I rolled a 20, butative. Oh, plus something. Oh, okay. So you're still going first. Okay. There we go. Sorry. Yeah, I thought I was.. You rolled a natural tiny? I rolled a 20. God damn it. You don't get any bonus for rolling a net 20 on initiative, and a lot of people in the A lot of people don't like that. They want there to be something that you get from it because 20 is a one in 20 I haven't come up with a house rule for it, so you just get to feel happy about it. I know that. Now, yeah, Small is in the middle. and Okay, so guiding bolt.. Oh, I got to figure how much these guys help at? No, Methods. Where is Oh, right. I have to open this. Go over here, and VI, this. No. Park effit makes it so the next roller goes against it gets dis managed. That'll be Surfina. Oh, she's a packing. She's going try.. Yeah, the three. Oh, you're hitting the big one? I'm going straight the table one. Good. And then. She won't be going for that one because she does not have her range attack out right now. She's just got her staff up.. Okay, they have some hit points. Where's the big one? I didn't like itscape that actually scares me. Good to know. I just cast a spell and like, let's look it in and then all of a sudden you looking in. looks at me. Yeah. I don't like it. I don't like this guy. It's a big method that are. Where are they? There it is. Okay, that's more like it. All right, this might actually be challenging, I hope. Okay, so you do that, what's the damage? Six. six, one, five, to eight. Six, six. Yeah, it's 18. Damn! Um. It is gonna have to. What's the description of that spell again? Pl bol to light of creature within range. target on hit takes r damage, and on the roll, made against it for the end of your next turn has advantage. Okay. It looks like it's about to fall off of the thing that it's on, but it's very quick and keeps its footing, but it is not ready for the next attack. It is very surprised, especially because you said hi. I thought that it was just going to be, you know, just a party or something. I don't know. Boom, boom room. He likes the Boom boom room. We like the boom, boom.. Sarah. You like being looked at. He wanted to. Sir is going to looked at. She's going to a t. Oh, wow. She's going to hit one of the wittler ones. I'm getting notified that the city of Hopeville is experiencing power outages.ville. I have to look at her character sheet to see what her staff's damage is now that she's all leveled up and everything. quarter staff. I think I can just click on it. What, doesn't sound right? Boom, boom? Oh. I thought I can roll this. All right, 1 d6 plus 3. Oh, I think I can just click on that. There we go. So she does some damage. All right. One of the littler ones.. goes as it takes a staff to the face. Let's see, so that's minus some points. Makes this that amount, okay? And then small. All right. Send it small. I'm gonna do the orb. Mm hmm. This a big guy does those? No, no. The big guy is still quite healthy. And he's. I might have been under describing. He's pretty burly for a thing that's made entirely out of sound. Yeah. Or supposedly. I mean, I don't really understand this elemental business, but, you know, I'm just running the game.. Well, let's the chratic or do that one. Okay. The 3D and I roll the same numbers on, I can orb can jump to another target. Okay. What is he? Where's that come from? Is that from the spell?.. Oh, my God.. I got it last, not last.. If you roll the same number on two or more of the day. Wow. That's so good. Yeah, this everything's within 30 feet of everything. Six. Five. Five. That's 12. That's Plus, is there a plus to it or is it just Okay, so 16. Wow. Oh, and that's against the big guy. All right. Wow. He's not happy about that. Let me tell you. He's not that.. There we go. I had to do math in my head. How dare I? He's Okay, now it's the method's turn. What's wrong? No. The little Mephs are gonna all go for Serafina because she is in front and they they're right there. Let me see what they do. They do. I think she's going to be all right. Her AC is is her AC. Her AC is 16. So they may not even hinder at all. Where are her actions? I mean, their actions claws, plus four to hit, breach five, Okay, so they all gather around her in a circle. And they all go. They're going for going at her with slashing damage and it's plus four to hit. Okay, so they have to get 12 or better. Okay, that's one hit. One miss, and a hit. It's a two hits for, where's your damage?4+2 What's your racing? Well, you're a magic user. Magic users never have high i. You're squishy. Yeah. What is it? Oh, my God.. Stupid methits rolled max damage. So that's. for sure 8 and. That's 12. No. No, she'll be fine. She's she's got 36 hit points to start with. Oh,w arm. She can. She does have flut arm. She. She's the teacher's pet. Yeah. And I'm the teacher. You want die. My I mean, you might die, but you probably won't die. You could die. I got a when I. Oh, yeah. Because I knew it was going to get harder. Smart. So she's taking 12 damage. Where is the... Oh, here we go. So that's going to go like that. All right. And then the big one. Let's see, so she's in the doorway or just inside, and the three are around her, the big one would have to go around her to get to you guys. Oh, well, let me see what attack. The big one has. Because that might change things if it has some kind of range attack. traits, actions, multi-attack, sonic slans, Thunderpulse, Shatter spell. Wow. That's gnarly. Uh. Okay, that's a terrible idea. I'm not doing that. Um. You know, I think Serfina's in the way. I think the big one is going to have to attack her. She's probably going to back up on her turn. Um. Send in there. All right. Yeah, Sonic Slam. Oh, I forgot to roll for Ray. What's. Let's try that again. Okay, good. Ray rolled low, so it hasn't been raised for me. Okay. Now, what is the attack of theus? Plus eight to hit. Oh, my God. Well, she can probably take this. Jesus. All right.. Oh, yeah, that's a hit, all right. And then it's double. One target. Two Sonic Slam attacks. All right, well,. That's a crit. Cine's not having a good day. I Why do I do this? Why did I send the healer in first? Hold on a second. That was stupid. I should have let you guys go in first. Okay. So, so it's gonna be 3D6 plus 5 twice. I'll just average that out. 3 d six, three is nine. That's 105. That's 15. plus oh, and then the crit is. Oh, and it's twice. So that's 30. Oh, she's down. Oh, question. Down? Well, on the ground, yeah.'s Bore that making death saves. I forgot that she had her That's only on that big one, right? Yeah. I don't know. It was Yeah, that's only in the big one.. And small Being used that too.. Oh, right. You should have rolled again in case you got a crit. instead of the one? So. five, six, and one? Yeah. So one more for that one. So this is a normal role? And this is a advantage, and you take an iron one, in this case of c me. So roll another G20 and if you get a 20, then then you what you one, so it't matter. Okay. He's like, what? All right. But that's good remembering. Um. Oh, well, what is your bardic inspiration do? I think it also gives. That's only a plus some die to a thing, right? That probably doesn't help in this case, because she did hit. Yeah,. Inspiration 16. Yeah, that won't make any difference. Okay.. Sfina is knocked out by the giant one, which then proceeds into the control room, where the rest of you are. and stands there. I need to make note that Sfina is at zero. You make an opportunity attack? Only when it leaves your threat range. So if it walked away from you, you'd get to go, ah! Or whatever. Okay. Now. Now,, who's next? I think it's probably throughixon. Yes. Thik is going to, he has a crush on Sfina. He's. He's going to. Oh, he had comprehend languages. Whatever. Oh, he did? No. He still does, technically. I just totally forgot. I'm so bad at playing multiple characters at once. M misunderstanding. He's going to let's see, what's the skill? There's a skill for this. Or maybe there's not. No, he doesn't have. Hmm. Nope, he does not have any way to. Oh, I can look at her inventory and see if she has a healing thing in here. Inventory. Uh.. Healer's kit, yes. Okay. So, uh Sunic, being a rogue, will hide, and don't ask me how he' able to hide in playing sight like this. Uh, you can't see him anymore. And what's happening is he's sneaking into the other room. Somehow using light and shadow in his favor, he just kind of disappears like camouflage. And what's happening is so he did a move action and then he's doing a a manipulate action to pull out Healer's kit from her pack, and that's going to be his whole turn. and next turn, he's going to try to stabilize her. Which will keep her from dying. And that's tic, and then Ray, I've got to look up Ws again. Wraith, Ray has.. I don't know if the kind of damage he does is going to make any difference to an elemental yet. Let's see, life drain, because they're not alive. They're just elementals. The target is not a creature in this case, so creates specter only works if there's a body to animate. Ray says, I'm useless. move in front of them so they would try. He's. In corporeal. Oh,. He's just like, well, actually, they're kind of incorporeal, too, in a way. He could try to distract them, that's true. Yeah. I know. So he doesn't say I'm useless. He says, have at you, and then goes and tries to distract the three. And then let me see how good he is at that. He's roll his performance. What's his charisma? He's plus two. Oh, wow. Okay, so they're distracted now. They're going to going to spend their next turn, well, one of them will spend its next turn finding out that they can't hurt them. Yeah. One of the little ones. Now it is Back to Songbird. You are in the control room, the large methhet is in front of you. It looks. disturbed. Like, it's not as it's not as coherent as it was when you first saw it. Think of them a little bit like a dust devil. Right? Like the wind is like doing a thing and it picks up the leaves and the dust and you can see that there's something there, but it's not the leaves and the dust that are there. It's the pattern of wind. That's what I think of as being an elemental of thunder. It's. Yeah, it's just, you see how the air is concentrated or unconcentrated around it. It's very, very strange. Definitely sci fi, not sci fi. I mean, CGI. Am I able to do a check to try to figure out how damage, how much how it has left? That would be a I have to look at the list of Skillsian. There's always a way to do a thing. That's one of the rules of GMing. Anything that the players come up with, you have to, yes, and. You can do a medicine check, but since it's hostile and you don't know it very well, it's going to be at some it's going to be a high DC difficulty. And that won't take up a move to interaction. No, you can do one free of things like that. Because you're just looking it over. And that's why it's so difficult too. What?. Oh, to reroll. Nice. Perfect. So when you play it, everybody hears redundant. Like, both the beginning and the end at the same time, and they hear two endings at the same. It's. It's like hearing in stereo, but instead of there being stuff in in two places, they're, like out of sync in a way that it's like a bin oral hearing type of thing. It's really weird, and it's going to take you guys a while to get used to it. But it does change reality. It changes a quick questionole. Does myumpet any reaction from them? Oh, like That's a great question. From playing the trumpet with the sound. Um, all four of them. just all? No, no, they. They seem to be slightly in awe, but still irritated that they were attacked. But they're somewhat subdued, I would say. It's. mechanically speaking, I'm gonna say that they take a minus one to their next thing. Okay. It's a little 5% chance.. I like that. Yeah. Okay, much. 17. for medicine check. Yes. You are able to. God. That was the difficulty. You think it is a little bit more than half health? Okay.. And it's only taken two hits, so. Yeah. It's hurting. It's going to start rolling to see if it's scared not too long. Well, I'm going to do a second level command spell to me and one other, especially if it's the one that is aggrod on scarfina to flee. Okay. the next one running away from us. to get some distance. Okay, the ones in the chamber have nowhere else to go, because the exit still locked. The one in the control room might run into the facility or it might run into the chamber. No. And let's see, let you speak one way or command. Tar must succeed on a wisdom saving throw against your 13. Spell DC. yeah, it rolled 18 on the die, so one of them succeeded. I'll see that was some of the little ones. And then the big one. The big one fails, and it runs it tries to run into the facility. You both and Tic all will get an opportunity. No, not Ticc he's inside. You two both get an opportunity attack on it.. Yeah, so as long as you have a melee weapon out, what's. Yeah. Oh, does that get me an attack too? Yeah, it gives you an attack because it's leaving your sphere of influence or your threat range, as they call it in the books. It's leaving your threat range because you scared it. And. And if small bean is carrying a melee weapon shield.. a lot. Do you have a melee weapon equipped? I guess I should say. You have your spear on you? Yeah. You can also attack with your spear. I can Mm hmm. Oh, but it's not plus one. It'll do half damage. It'll still do some damage because just being in the way of the sound disrupts the you know, hand wavy. So, yeah. And you? No, you're just reacting to its leaving your threat range. Oh, I Yes, but you only get one per round, so if anything else enters and leaves your threat range, it will not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you take this opportunity. You get to pick. But yeah, go ahead and roll your attacks, because the other ones aren't gonna go running through here. For cutting words is that this this opportunity attack. It does? Yeah. Holy crap. I didn't know that. Sunbird cutting words. Where is that? Oh, that's one of your actions, isn't it? Yeah. Uh. Barticans for cutting words. Actions in combat. When a creature that you see makes a damage role or succeeds in this thing, you can expand one use of and subtract the number. What is that? That's what I was wondering earlier when it doesn't cast and do an opport to do that isunity. That towards this. I'm thinking. I believe the way this works is if it succeeded at something, then you could, as a reaction, insult it. Okay. with the effect of damaging it if you're insult is successful. next time it attacks, I could doension. If it succeeds in its attack, yes. Okay. I'll. Yeah, go ahead and roll your attack. Let me see what its AC is. So I'm going to be able to do that right now, though, right? It's the cutting words? Nah. Okay. Where is your AC? There it is. Okay.. How am I doing this? We. Old man, I've got to hurry up. Where I find the damage to the dagger. It's, uh, Dagger... Looks like you don't currently have your dagger equipped. Oh, wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong character. No, this is the right character. like that.. You can, uh, I'll go ahead and say you had it equipped. So, yeah, it's going to be 1 d4 plus something. 2. So. Okay. Three. Every little bit helps. That wasn't supposed to be a joke funny. It's It's hurting. And then what about your spear tech? My spear. Oh, wait, what was your attackle? To hit the Titting 20? Yeah. Oh, you got a 20? Oh, yeah, no, where are you talking about? When you get your opportunity tech, you don't just roll the damage, you also have to roll the attack.? Yeah.. And then you add your.. 13 do I have? My. Yeah. In Tact bonus. Which is? Is it?? It is. It is well, your unarmed strike is plus two, so I'm guessing it's gonna be at least plus two, which means you do hit. So, yeah, so you got your three damage in. Okay. Now Thunder's attack. I cross? You can't do the opportunity attack with a range weapon. Yeah. Yeah, probably the spear would be good.. Attack roll first. Different modes. There's throwing versus striking. I think 18's the one you want. Okay. Let me see. Where's small be? There you are. Spear, uh Piercing versus Piercing. I need to actually read the description Versatile I might be getting that wrong, but I don't know. I'm not. What'd you got? Okay, that's a miss. Well, that was the How much is your bonus? And the damage doesn't matter. Oh, my God. It's AC is more than eight. thing. It's all right. It's okay. It was an opportunity tag. It's All right. No! Now, that was songbird's attack that ended up making it run away. Now it is, Sapfina's turn. She's going to roll not to die.. She rolled low, so that's one death save down. If she rolls two more failures or one critical failure before she gets stabilized, she will be dead, dead, and I will have to change the world to like, do Sina that just spoke at the in the future will have to be. her, she'll have to have been returned from the dead somehow or something. Anyway, let's I think Thunickel stabilizer. It'll be fine. I get her on the. That'll work. Any kind of healing? Any kind of healing? It will even bring her back up. If you comb her hair, it will give her a few points of health and she'll be back. stabilizes her. All right. You can do that in a moment. It is her. Okay, so she did that. Now it is your turn. You can let me think about this. You can reach her without. Oh, yeah, the thing went into the hallway. So you hit her or hit her. You hit the Mphit, you missed, it went down the hallway. It's sprinting. It's going to run into some automation and I have to fight them. You can go in. It's It ran let's see, it's not its turn yet, but it's going to on its turn How does that work? Hold on. Command. I have to look at command again. Yeah, the big one. I have to look at command. Songbird. Spells. Oh was going to say, you guys just all runs. Target spend its turn. Okay, so that opportunity attack should not have happened yet, but it's about two, and we'll just say that it does then. So it is currently between you guys, but you can get to Sfina without leaving its threat range. So, yeah.. is my move? That will be your move and your action to. So it's a move to get next to her, because she's currently through the doorway. And then it's an action to apply the comb to her. But you can roll your if you do that it up Phoenix. Yeah. Yeah, and then he'll shoot, shoot, shoot. Or actually, he's hiding right now, so he'll be able to do backstab. He'll get sneak attack damage, which is huge. Yeah.? Um. Oh, just 18. for healing. Plus your Plus two is five. So I will. She is back up, but she has five hit points.. Success. Oh, wait, you still have. I don't well any of the targets versions on. Well, you do have that for a.. Hold on... Yeah. Okay, now does it show her Yes, she's alive. That's great. Classic Hollywood coming back to life scene. Next are the Mephits. One of them tries to attack, what's his name Another one tries to attack Small.. And what's your raceacing again? I'm sorry. Oh, I can just look it up here. 13 and let me see what the methits to hit attack, whatever you call it is, it is claws is 0 plus 4 to hit? Wow. Okay, so it does hit you, but they're tiny little guys, so it shouldn't be a big deal. Of course, Serafina thought that too. and we also. Okay, it does. Just the one. Okay, so it does floor damage to you. All right. And uh.. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm supposed to be doing that. I wonder if I'm supposed to alternate or eh. Let scene doesn't yeah, it's just fine. Um And then, so that was the one got distracted, one attacked you, attacked. One is I already did that one. I'm trying to think of what the third one, if it's gonna be attacking small or Sapfina. Serafina looks less threatening, small, just oh earlier hit the big one for a lot so yeah, the second one's going to go for small as well. And hits for. What can I go? That is for things like foraging and remembering things about nature and stuff like that. It hits you for five. These things are just, they're just flying daggers. These things, these methods.. And then the big one is going to run for its life and take the damage that we already calculated. Running for your life? Yeah, because it got commanded to flee, and so it's like, I'll right, man, you don't have. Oh, like to flee forever. Well, until it gets away and then it'll like rethink its life and stuff. Let me see. Yeah, the automatons are going to get it. Because they The facility itself is monitoring all this, and would already have sent help back up. It just it's taking a while because most of the backup is outside or under repair. But, it does a double move, which takes it somewhere between 40 and 80 feet away. got a big out here. You'll, of course, hear noises of it screaming. You'll hear a thunder wave go off, because that's one of it's a things. I just picture it down the fighting all the on the arm in like three time we were just like listening.. They were on their way and then it ran into them and it's like, oh shit.. Holy crap. Okay. Um. And then it is Fix's turn. Funic is going to backstab one of these little ones. Fic, where what's your sneak attack thing? How do I sneak attack in this? Is that down below? Bonus action. reaction sneak attack. There it is. So we're going to do a sneak attack.. Oh, okay, so it doesn't change the to hit, but. Oh, I wonder if it's better to use the. No, it doesn't want to use the bow because it would be a disadvantage. All right, let's just roll this straight. Oh. Really funic? Are you I think he's distracted by Serfina. He's emotional. Yeah, he's all wound up.. He's all wound up. He's like, I'll save you. And then he totally whipped it. But the good news is he doesn't reveal himself. He's still hiding. Does he want to move? No, I don't think he does. All right, who's next? Ray. Nobody's going to fall for Ray's Antics a second time.. Ray is going to say, you guys got this, or something like that. Thanks, Ray. And drift through the walls. Who knows where he's going? He might be doing something helpful. I'm not sure he can. And then it's back to the songbird. Bruno.. Command again on the two healthiest ones The un unhurt ones, okay. And command them also to. Okay, let's see. That was your plus. Oh, you're 13. You have to beat a 13 with their. We have. It's just really funny. I gotta say that is classic Bard. He's playing the role. to a T. That is absolutely how Bardards do. Bards do do three things. They control the enemy, they buff their friends. And that's it. Actually, two things. They buff their friends and debuff the enemies and get you out ofuations. And make it so you don't have to fight. It's great when you're playing a real resource intensive game where you have to watch all of your reagents, your money, your health, your spell slots. Yeah. It's a thing. Anyway, so they're going to roll not to be commanded. That one failed. Jeez. That doesn't count. Florida d don't count if you didn't know. Oh, that's a crit. All right, well, it doesn't count when you just don't a save, but it works on one of them. It looks around. Oh, wait, it's on its turn and it runs, that's right. I need to stick with the rules. All right. We can also attack it when it runs through our. You can. Yeah, as it runs through your your space. It's going to try to, well, it's definitely going to leave her threat range because it's going to try to get away from you and that would mean getting away from her. But it doesn't have far to go. It's in this room. It might try to go through both of you to get out the other way because it doesn't know what's out there. Yeah. actual So that was Songbirds. Sarah is alive and she is going to heal herself.. Sarah is. She's going to, I believe she can lay on hands herself, which sounds dirty. As it going to action, you can touch a creature, which could be yourself, good, and restore a number of hit points up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool, which is currently, well, it should be 20 because she hasn't used this since the rest. I just didn't do the long rest. So she is going to use all of them because she is panicking. So now she looks a lot better. She went down fast and then she came back up fast. And this is now zero. Oh, I guess I have to hit this like a whole bunch. There, confirm. Okay. And then, is she gonna move? Oh, I' think so. I think she's just going to stand there. Oh, it's a move action to stand up, so she's doing that. Well, it's half a action, but that's fine. And then next is Small. You have, there are three Mephits surrounding Serafina. You think that Tunic might be in the area. magic. Okay. And I'll do the second level. Oh, shit. Let's see. What does upcasting. Oh, well, maybe not then. So it sends three missiles out and she can pick where they all go. Upcasting doesn't do anything, huh? That can't be right. Oh, right, just being a higher level does something. That's all. Okay. So you're doing 14 plus 1, 2, the three, and you don't even have to, yeah, you just have to roll the damage. Just left. No, because it's not a det20. Yeah. Okay, so two for one of them. It yelps. And what about the other two? In this case, yeah. Because I said so, that's all. Okay. Okay. There are three hurt Mitzs. And it was full damage because it was ice. And that means this one now has this amount left and these two has this amount left. Okay. And now it's the methits, and they have been commanded to. One of them is running. Wait. Oh, you did two of them, two that weren't damaged. That's right. I remember now. So this one now is going to be fleeing, and it's going to run through. I'm going to say that it. So normally it's supposed to go directly away from any threats. But because of the closed space and because the bigger method went the other way, it's going to go after the bigger Mffod. It thinks that that's the best it can do for fleeing. So you both get an attack of opportunity on it. Go ahead and roll your D20s for hitting it. 8 plus plus my You're too hit. Let me see, which one you're using? You're using a dagger? That's probably not going to be enough. Let's see. The songbird, Actions. Oh, you still don't have to equip the dagger and then go by Okay, that's not enough. That would be a 10. it That's the damage, but to hit is D20. Do you want to. Yeah, that's So, you don't have anything left to bump that up with. So that's just the 10. So that misses, and you roll five. That's right, you told me that. Sorry. Okay. It worms its way through somehow. Oh, but it's also passing Serafina and Thunik. It is passing them. So. Fna is F attacks with her quarter staff. Oops. She hits. for.... Ah, she hits for some. She hits for five. That's this one, minus five, and then. then.crimouthunic. Actions, attack,, Dagger. That's a hit. for some more. Let me see. Oh, boy, it's hurting. It's almost gone. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, you don't. Here. And that was. Oh, right, and then the other one is going to attack. It's not? No. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna roll whether the other one shits itself.. That means it's still brave, I guess. That's stupid. I was secretly hoping it would run away and take hits and that you guys would basically be done with, because there's only 13 minutes left before you're supposed to get a cliffhanger.. Let's see, that was the Mffitz. That one is still and used to attack, so going to attack small bean. No, it's going to attack, so that's you know. and it's gonna miss, huh? Oh, shit. It It happens sometimes. I'll be late? They tried to attack Shenina miss. Just the one, the one. Oh, wait, there's two of them. Yeah. I forgot about the other one. It's really misses. Shout out to the two crew. And, um. and then it gets another chance.. Tunik hits for, and this is gonna be a. Oh, I didn't go over to the... All right, here we go. Dagger. This is Sneak Attack 2D6 for. Okay, is that enough? Well, that's the one that's getting away, so that's not the one that says this one. Oh, yeah, takes Nope, that's not enough. Okay.'s so close. The first little method that Little Miss M that got hit is very hurt right now. The one that ran away, was also very hurt right now. The other one's kind of hurt.. And, uh, you know what? I'm going to make the other one also for graory. No, still brave. Okay, fine. For whatever reason, these little Mephits are, they think they can take you? There's two left and one almost. The one running, yeah, it's going to get taken out by cleanup. You know, I't it's safe to say you guys easily wipe the floor with these two. There's four of you, two of them. You've got the numbers advantage, the cavalry's coming in, the robots. The robots are coming. So, since I have 10 minutes to get you to the cliffhanger. Yeah, it was mostly that. Yeah, it took you 30 minutes to decide whether or not to even go through there. But I didn't want to rush you, because. Yeah. I feel like that's an important part of the game, the deciding stuff like that. And there was nothing pushing you. And I didn't see any reason to push you because as far as I'm concerned, this is your base, you can do what you want. Yeah. Well, I really like that sort of home base idea that the thing you can count on, you can fight from, a pedestal, you can... Anyway... So, oh, right, I forgot about the effects of being in that room. So, small and serapfina and tunic are in that room and are suffering from believe there's a chance you have nausea. Let's see. There's all kinds of side effects. Where did it go? Where did it go? What does this do? Outline, that's what I want. Environmental mechanics, that's I was looking for. DC 12 con Save every minute, so we'll just do one of those for. Yeah, you're gonna roll one, that was. Plus your constitution bonus. So that's a plus one. So that's 11. You're going to be nauseous for one round, or not a round beer.? Yeah, it's a same thing.. So, hold on, no, my Constitution is. I can look on here. Oh, plus four? Okay, then you're fine. Let's see here. Small bean. Yeah. Do I give you that? No, you're outside of the chamber. You're protected from the stuff. Oh, yeah, you do have a proficiency in constitution. Well, that's interesting. That's pretty unusual for a sorcerer, but it's working in your favor. Sfina, however, is not well and Funic is fine. Okay. Um But since you guys are out of the fight, I think that's all right.. You, um. You were already planning on adjusting dishes. Also, the robots start showing up, and they just take over. They start repairing the control panels. Some of them go into the room and start adjusting dishes. And the emergency exit goes green. You can go out that way now. If you'd like. If you don't go out that way, I won't have a cliffhanger for you. don't? If you don't go out, I won't have a cliffhanger. I went out. All right, we go. All right, you go out. It locks behind you. Oh. But that's okay. You go, dump, dump, dum, dum. The four of you go stomping through the exit. It's. There's no more, nothing. don't encounter anything along the way. You see lots of things that are interesting for historical purposes of, oh, here, there's the thing that got dug this way and got sealed off on that way and all that kind of stuff. But it's not outside but we're on our way out. You're going to cave on your way out. There's a slight incline to it. You're going up. Oh, no, actually, you guys are already up when you got to the facility. You're going down. You, like we'll be. Right. Okay. Well, Ray took off. He'll know. Okay. He's going to stay at the base. He doesn't want to go anywhere else in his own life. He's. That's right. Well, he wouldn't know what to do in the outside world. He' coming back. Mm. Okay. Then I'm finally leaving. You' administrators.. You can come back in through the front door, but. Oh, you can see eventually. You'll just have to come back later. It curves around conveniently enough. And so it's facing it's taking you west as it goes down. And you come out, get the world map. Oh, let me have that tablet. Let me see here. Oh, it's going to have to wake up. Wake up! Yeah. Here we go. lights are tint. My comb hair. Oh, yeah. Well, you're about to kick. You' get a long. You're gonna get a long rest. You're easily going to get a long rest. You're not going to get a level this time, because I've been too generous in the training wheels are coming off. That was not as hard as it was supposed to be, but..ers when you didn't fight more or because I like It's partly me and it's partly you. It's you are just really good at avoiding conflict, which is.. I's. It's so good, though. I admire that so much. I've always disliked the games that are super combat heavy. So you're making my day. Thunder maybe not so much, but that's okay.. The day will come when you're like, oh, no, I'm out of spells and thunder. I say, I got this. I don't have anything that like a situation. I only have things that tend to situation. That's a good point. Yeah. For this chapter. Yeah. Yeah. I want a study you up so you can fill it. Yeah. Yeah. Cziest chapter. Oh, I should have gone to table of contest. Oh, here we go. Fandalin. Oh, this isn't gonna show the whole world, is it? Come on. Oh, no, that's just the town. So you're you're stomping, you're stomping, you're walking, and you come to another door, but it's just a mundane door that you just take the thing off of and walk through, and you are out what time is it? You've been dicking around for a while. I'm gonna say it's evening. It's still light out, but the sun is there's a nice sunset. It's a clear sky. You came in earlier today when the sun was high, and then you did a whole bunch of stuff and now it's evening. And I need to go back one more chapter and hopefully there's a nap. No. Oh, my God. It's your dog. Man. Okay, I need another tab, and I need to search for Fun. No, I need to search for Sword Coast. That's right. Sword. Coast. map. Uh, yeah, that'll that'll probably work. Let's try that out. Mm mm Factions, map of the sword coast. That sounds promising. And then I can show you guys. There we go. Okay. So. Well, that's not quite. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm looking for right there. And let's do viewplayer version. Okay. don't need this anymore. So you guys were in here, basically this is not right there. and thenlin's over here. Come out. part of the way too, Sand. It takes you a while. You spend an hour and a half walking in that emergency exit, and then you kind of hop about an hour away and that's that's hour ri looking back, you can see. There are traces of blue on it, like the traces you saw on the floor. And there's a red trace around the bottom and you also found that the noises that you were hearing are still continuing to change, presumably because of the battle's with the creatures and such.. And since I still have two minutes, you can continue back to Fandelin. There's not really anywhere else you'd want to go at this time. And they will tell you. that a couple of hours ago, everything in town pointed at the mountain, all the metal things, all the fairest things in town. And currently, oh, and it's one of the cragm tribe are in town, and they're freaking out, and they say, our weapons are vibrating. And, uh yeah, that is. Oh, right. And one other thing. One other thing. You have a message from your grandmother. Small bean. She's been watching you. grandma? Your grandma in the game? No, like Yeah. Yeah.. No, no, your actual grandma has been watching you the whole time since you left. And she has sent presence. Well, she sent a message saying. I had seconds left to tell you this. Where did it go? Where is the twist? You didn't know about scrying. Also, your grandmother's incredibly powerful. You probably didn't know that either... Oh, right, I remember what it said. Don't use the Forge." That's what it said. Oh, yeah. But you don't know her motives are, so.. Oh. Um. settle, like, making catastrophic. Oh, you I got a cold? Yeah, andic and Sfina have stuff. Come on. Tic and so Serafina's gonna say, this has been a blast, I've got some incredible notes. I need to head back to the university and write this up.". Yeah, that too. And Funik's going to say, "Can I come? And she's going to say, "Yeah, all right." So the two of them are headed back to town. I haven't figured out which town is. What's that? I'm gonna tell you right now, that was Claude's idea. I It never occurred to me. I was thinking like, so earlier, I was wondering if we could somehow mask this place in
