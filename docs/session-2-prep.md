# Session 2 Planning Notes: Thunder Mountain

## Opening (5 min)
**Professor Brightletter**: *"The morning they approached Thunder Mountain, none of them suspected they were about to solve a mystery that had puzzled dwarven engineers for centuries..."*

## Goblin NPCs
- **Ghrek**: Knows safe paths, carries rope/gear, nervous but dutiful
- **Vorn**: Stoic tracker, good with mountain dangers
- **Brak**: Mad at Ghrek for never sharing mountain knowledge before, grumpy but comes along

## Session Structure (Dust2 Map Layout)

### Act I: Mountain Approach (30-45 min, scalable)
**Location**: T Spawn to Long Doors (surface areas)

**Owlbear Encounter** (scaling options):
- **Quick**: Songbird's Animal Handling (+4) succeeds, owlbear withdraws
- **Medium**: 2-3 round tactical encounter
- **Long**: Full combat with environmental complications

**Route Choice** (Ghrek's knowledge):
- **A Long**: Obvious approach, owlbear territory
- **Catwalk/Suicide**: Hidden goblin path, requires stealth
- **A Short**: Academic route (Seraphina spots), requires Athletics

### Act II: The Underground (45-60 min)
**Safe Zones**: Stairs, A Short (Ghrek's knowledge saves them from some encounters)
**Danger Zones**: 
- **Mid/Top Mid**: Bulette territory (rumbling, avoid)
- **CT Mid**: Sentinel patrol routes
- **Outside Long**: Where owlbears and bulettes fight

### Act III: The Seal Chamber (CT Spawn)
**Discovery**: Ancient dwarven mechanism - part engineering, part magic

## The Power System (Background Info)
- **Dead-man switch**: Triggered in 951 DR when dwarves driven out
- **Current state**: ~30% power (several toroids spun down)
- **Problem**: Bulette burrowing disrupted water flows
- **Hysteresis**: Needs 80% power to exit emergency mode (currently at 30%)

## The Seal Puzzle (Multiple Solutions)

### Solution A: Smol Bean's Military Magic
**Challenge**: Arcane resonance chambers need reactivation
**Success**: "Your siege warfare experience tells you these crystals need synchronized casting"

### Solution B: Songbird's Performance  
**Challenge**: Harmonic frequencies unlock mechanism
**Success**: "Your musical training detects the resonant frequency this chamber was tuned for"

### Solution C: Seraphina's Scholarship
**Challenge**: Dwarven religious symbolism
**Success**: "Your research reveals this is a consecration lock - it opens for those with pure intent"

### Solution D: Teamwork (BEST!)
**Challenge**: Three-person override system
**Requirement**: All three must maintain positions for 30+ seconds
- Smol Bean: Magical resonance (Concentration)
- Seraphina: Mechanical pressure (Investigation + Athletics)  
- Songbird: Harmonic foundation (Performance)

## Combat Encounters (If Needed)

### Dwarven Sentinels
**Base Stats**: Animated Armor (AC 18, HP 33, Speed 25)
**Reflavor**: Steam attacks, crystalline cores, hydraulic joints
**Weakness**: Vulnerable to thunder damage
**Behavior**: Patrol patterns, retreat at 25% HP

### Scaling Options
- **Easy**: 1 Sentinel, 2 inactive turrets
- **Medium**: 2 Sentinels, 1 active turret  
- **Hard**: 3 Sentinels, 2 turrets

### Secret Maintenance Airlock
**Discovery**: Follow fleeing sentinel (DC 17 INT to realize it's an airlock)
**Entry**: Requires magical signature + metal characteristics
**Bypass**: Creative solutions or hidden override panel

## Special Discovery: Mechanical Familiar

### Location
Near entrance guard post, looks like metal dog sculpture (toaster-sized)

### Current State  
Completely dormant, battle damage from 951 DR, beautiful dwarven craftsmanship

### Awakening Stages
- **Session 2**: Completely inactive
- **Session 3**: Eyes flicker when power fluctuates (Smol Bean notices first)
- **Session 4**: More activity in repair bay
- **Full awakening**: When toroids restored

### Stats (When Awakened)
Modified Pseudodragon: AC 13, HP 7, Speed 30 ft, hover 60 ft
- Telepathic bond with Smol Bean
- Guardian protocol, magical resonance detection
- Perfect size for scouting and retrieving small objects

## Sound Design (Quick Setup)
- **Surface**: Mountain wind + distant animal sounds
- **Caves**: Echo acoustics + water dripping
- **Mechanism areas**: Rhythmic humming + occasional "thoom" (hydraulic shock)
- **YouTube search**: "mountain ambiance" + "dwarven machinery"

## Pacing Control Levers

### Extend Session
- Detailed mechanism investigation
- More goblin mountain lore
- Additional puzzle complexity
- Environmental complications

### Compress Session  
- Skip owlbear complexity
- Fast-forward approach
- Obvious puzzle solution works immediately
- Save mechanism details for Session 3

## Session 2 Cliffhanger
Mechanism activates, passage opens into Wave Echo Cave proper. Set up for Session 3 Foundry reveal.

## Emergency Backup Plans
- **No Foundry ready**: Draw Dust2 layout as they explore
- **Combat too complex**: Use simple environmental hazards instead
- **Puzzle too hard**: Ghrek offers helpful hints about dwarven engineering

## Key Reminders
- Let Thunder choose how Smol Bean reacts to mechanical familiar
- Brak is grumpy about being left out of Ghrek's secrets
- Multiple valid solutions to every challenge
- Focus on character strengths, not player knowledge

**Success Goal**: End with passage open, party excited to explore deeper, Foundry prep time secured! ðŸŽ²
