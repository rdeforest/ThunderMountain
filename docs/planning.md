# D&D Campaign Planning Context & Decisions

## Campaign Foundation & Player Context

### Player Profiles
- **Thunder** (Robert's niece): Team lead at tech company, former real estate agent, highly practical, believes in paying for quality, new to D&D
- **Kyle** (Thunder's boyfriend): Police officer, has prior D&D experience, practical discipline
- **Sarah** (friend): Has prior D&D experience, unknown depth/versions
- **Dogs**: Thunder & Kyle have dogs, need to confirm management strategy before sessions

### Campaign Theme: "Little Game, Big World"
- **Core Concept**: Intimate 6-session story set against an immense, scrollable world
- **Inspiration**: Robert's childhood experience of standing next to enormous ship in San Francisco - breathtaking sense of scale
- **Implementation**: Start in single tavern, expand to world map showing vast scope
- **Narrative Arc**: Classic tropes with subverted species stereotypes as the "surprise"

## Technical Setup & Equipment Strategy

### Projector Technology Decision
- **Primary Choice**: WEMAX Dice Mini (~$400, Android OS, D&D-marketed)
- **Rationale**: Built-in OS eliminates laptop positioning issues, supports casting
- **Implementation**: Foundry VTT running locally on laptop, cast to projector
- **Player Interaction**: Physical minis on projected surface, Robert controls NPCs from laptop
- **Acquisition Timing**: Reward for successful Session 1, not upfront investment

### Battle Map Philosophy
- **Space Adaptation**: Adjust encounter scope to available table space rather than forcing accommodation
- **Scalability**: Use grid squares/hexes to represent larger areas for travel scenes
- **Visual Impact**: Create sense of world immensity through map scrolling and scale representation
- **Backup Plan**: Standard battle mat (24"x36") for space-constrained scenarios

### Print Strategy at Staples
- **Custom battle maps**: High-quality large format prints for specific encounters
- **Character materials**: Sheets, reference cards, safety tools
- **GM aids**: Cheat sheets, recovery phrases, break point reminders

## GM Philosophy & Support Systems

### Robert's GM Experience & Concerns
- **Background**: Two previous Pathfinder 1e campaigns (handed off due to overwhelm)
- **Time Gap**: Years since last GMing
- **Priority**: Best experience for players, especially Thunder as new player
- **Confidence Building**: Equipment quality as psychological support ("look like you know what you're doing")

### Identified GM Challenges & Solutions
1. **Stun-Lock Recovery**: "Give me one second to process that brilliance" / "That's so good I need a moment"
2. **Energy Management**: Hourly breaks, delegate to experienced players ("Kyle, help me run this combat")
3. **Consistency Catches**: Turn contradictions into worldbuilding opportunities ("Why WOULD the baron lie about being bald?")

### Advanced GM Techniques Planned
- **Spotlight Management**: Use character strengths to redistribute focus naturally
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjust through environment/narrative, not obvious stat changes
- **Player Agency Priority**: "Yes, and..." approach over railroading back to prep
- **Passive Engagement**: Escalate environmental pressure until action becomes inevitable

## Session Structure & Logistics

### Space Assessment Strategy
- **Location**: Thunder & Kyle's place (never been there before)
- **Live Assessment**: Evaluate during Session 0 arrival
- **Expectations**: Likely adequate space based on their professions and lifestyle
- **Adaptation**: Real-time decision on projector vs battle mat based on physical reality
- **Communication**: Chat with Claude during Session 0 for live consultation

### Session 0 Specific Elements
- **Fourth Chair Mystery**: Always set up four chairs even with three players - narrative flexibility tool
- **Anonymous Safety Requests**: Pre-cut folded paper + identical pens, everyone writes something
- **Character Connections**: Flexible timing - Session 0 if natural, Session 1 if forced
- **"Why Are You Here?"**: Save for Session 1 if character relationships don't emerge organically

## Future Development Areas

### NPC Voice Strategy (To Be Developed)
- **Goal**: Distinct, consistent voices for immersion
- **Challenge**: More voices than Robert has done recently
- **Approach**: Develop voice "character sheets" with anchors and fallback techniques
- **Skills**: Robert good with impressions, needs consistency systems

### World Building Resources Needed
- **Forgotten Realms Material Plane Map**: Locate authoritative consolidated version
- **Reference Priority**: Ed Greenwood's canonical maps, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
- **Implementation**: Support for scrolling world map in Foundry VTT

### Equipment Procurement Strategy
- **Local Game Store Priority**: SDRA networking opportunity while buying core books
- **Quality Investment Philosophy**: Thunder's "pay for good life" approach influences group expectations
- **Professional Appearance**: Wyrmwood screen, quality dice as confidence builders

## Safety & Table Management

### Established Safety Protocols
- **X-Card System**: Tap to skip, no explanation required
- **Content Boundaries**: No sexual content on camera, no implied sexual violence
- **24-Hour Notice**: Preferred absence communication
- **Character Death Policy**: Possible but not targeted

### Enhanced Safety Implementation
- **Anonymous Request System**: Physical paper method ensuring complete privacy
- **Universal Participation**: Everyone writes something to prevent singling out
- **Private Review**: Robert examines requests alone, no attribution possible

## Technology Integration Philosophy

### Hybrid Analog/Digital Approach
- **Start Simple**: Physical materials first, add digital as comfort increases
- **Player Choice**: Physical character sheets with optional D&D Beyond management
- **Robert's Setup**: D&D Beyond on laptop + BOOX e-ink tablet for rules ("will blow their minds")
- **Backup Plans**: Always have non-digital alternatives ready

### Audio Environment
- **Ambient Playlists**: Pre-made for tavern, forest day/night, combat, mystery
- **Equipment**: Laptop audio or portable speaker if needed
- **Philosophy**: Enhancement not requirement, removable if problematic

## Collaboration Meta-Context

### Robert-Claude Partnership Dynamics
- **Equal Collaboration**: Peer-level technical discussion, no hand-holding needed
- **Trust Calibration**: Proven reliability, comprehensive checking no longer required
- **Communication Style**: Direct feedback appreciated, skip recaps unless requested
- **Shared Aesthetics**: Function-driven beauty, vertical alignment preferences

### Linguistic Traditions Established
- **"As is tradition"**: Instant declaration of new patterns as customs
- **South Park References**: Underpants gnomes "???" â†’ "profit" structure recognition
- **Technical Poetry**: Describing complex systems with dramatic language
- **Professional Courtesy**: Acknowledge but don't overexplain shared cultural references

*This represents the complete planning context for Robert's first GM experience, emphasizing both technical excellence and collaborative storytelling in service of creating an exceptional introduction to D&D for Thunder while satisfying experienced players Kyle and Sarah.*
