# Ex-Mayor's Scheme
**Type**: Political Intrigue | **Antagonist**: [Harbin Wester](../../lore/characters/npc/phandalin/harbin-wester.md) 📍

## The Scheme
Harbin wants to claim legal authority over Thunder Mountain as "rightful mayor"
to escape massive debts to Waterdeep merchants.

## His Leverage
| Asset | How He'll Use It |
|-------|------------------|
| Past Authority | "Still technically mayor" argument |
| Noble Contacts | Waterdeep legal backing |
| Local Knowledge | Knows party's reputation |
| Desperation | Will take big risks |

## His Approach (Session 5)
1. Friendly greeting: "Heroes return!"
2. Appeal to civic duty
3. Offer "official sanction"
4. Threaten legal complications if refused

## Counter-Strategies
- Point out he's NOT mayor anymore (1491)
- Publicly embarrass him (risky)
- Offer alternative deal
- Involve current mayor
- Let him dig his own grave

## Escalation Path
Refuses → Contacts Waterdeep → Legal threats → Desperate measures
