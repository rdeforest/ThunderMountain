# Vibrating Weapons Crisis
**Type**: Regional Problem | **Affected**: All metal weapons in region

## The Phenomenon
Yesterday's mountain awakening caused all metal to point toward Thunder Mountain.
Now Cragmaw weapons continue vibrating/humming. Other tribes affected too.

## Current Impact
| Group | Effect | Response |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Cragmaws | Weapons "singing" | Sent [envoys](../../../lore/characters/npc/cragmaw/envoys.md) üìç |
| Warriors | Fear cursed weapons | Some refuse to fight |
| Town | Tools pointed briefly | Confusion, concern |
| Smiths | Pliers/tools affected | [Maza](../../../lore/characters/pc/maza.md) üìç investigating |

## Theories
- Residual magical resonance from facility
- Forge awakening affects all metal
- Ancient defense system active
- Something calling metal items home

## Resolution Options
- Return to facility, adjust systems
- Magical dampening ritual
- Wait for effect to fade naturally
- Use effect to advantage somehow?
