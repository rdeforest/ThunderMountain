# Opening Scene - Departure from Phandalin
**Time**: Dawn | **Location**: The Sleeping Giant | **Mood**: Anticipatory

## Maza's Farewell
"Ay, heading to Leilon? Smart move, little ones. 
That facility ain't going nowhere, but opportunities
in a rebuilding town? Those dry up fast."

*She hands them a wrapped bundle*
"Trail bread. My recipe. Lasts two weeks,
tastes like boot leather, fills you up good."

## Route Decision Point
**Maza's Advice**: 
- **Roads** (2-3 days): "Safer, patrols sometimes"
- **Grasslands** (1 day): "Faster, but dire wolves hunt there"

## What They Know
- Leilon is rebuilding under Neverwinter's protection
- Work opportunities for skilled individuals
- The cursed tower was torn down
- Town is "safe" compared to wilderness

## Departure Details
- Cool morning, dew on grass
- Merchants preparing caravans for Triboar
- Grista waves from her door
