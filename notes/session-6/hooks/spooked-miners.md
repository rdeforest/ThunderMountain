# The Spooked Miners
**Source**: Tavern gossip | **Pay**: 15 gp each from Sera | **Mystery**: Building

## The Rumor
Miners working new copper vein hit a void.
Strange symbols on the walls inside.
Now they refuse to go back down.

## Miner Testimony (at Miner's Rest)
"Weren't no natural cave. Too smooth.
And the symbols... they hurt to look at.
Jorik touched one, hasn't spoke since."

## The Mine (30 minutes east)
- Entrance well-marked, equipment abandoned
- Tunnel descends 50 ft
- Void at end: 20x20 chamber

## The Chamber
**Actually**: Ancient Netherese storage
**Symbols**: Warning labels in Netherese
**Effect**: Psychic damage (1 hp) if touched
**Contents**: 3 sealed ceramic jars

## The Jars Contain
1. Preservative fluid (now poison)
2. Metallic dust (residuum, 100 gp value)
3. Still-sealed (contains minor magic item)

## Consequences
- Report to Sera = paid, site sealed
- Keep secrets = potential magic research
- Break jars carelessly = poison cloud!
