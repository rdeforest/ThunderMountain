# The Tower Site Mystery
**Employer**: Captain Thornwell | **Pay**: 25 gp each | **Danger**: Unknown

## The Situation
House of Thalivar's foundation = problem zone.
Workers report whispers, cold spots, shadows.
Three workers quit yesterday. Foreman furious.

## Investigation Reveals
**DC 10 Perception**: Cold increases near center
**DC 12 Arcana**: Lingering planar energy
**DC 15 Investigation**: Old basement partially intact

## The Truth
Weak spot between planes remains.
Not dangerous... yet. But getting worse.
Something trying to push through?

## Potential Outcomes
- **Ignore it**: Problem escalates next session
- **Report it**: Thornwell panics, asks them to fix
- **Fix it**: Requires magical solution (quest hook)
- **Make worse**: Something comes through...

## Connection to Facility?
The planar energies resonate with Thunder Mountain's
crystal frequencies. Someone with right knowledge
could link them... for good or ill.
