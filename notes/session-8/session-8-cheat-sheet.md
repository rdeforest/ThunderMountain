# Session 8 Cheat Sheet

## Starting Situation
**Location**:      Leilon excavation, Netherese portal chamber
**Present**:       Smol Bean, Songbird, Lord Neverember, 3 miners (Torvald, Edric, Kathra)
**Portal status**: Active, pointing to Nine Hells (safe remote desert)
**Door**:          Open to hallway leading to Level 15 of spiral base
**Money**:         ~25gp in pocket + verbal agreement with Neverember for inn (he pays construction/staffing, they get business)

## If Players Want to Explore Base

### Entry Point
Hallway connects to **Level 15** (mid-level of spiral)

### Available Levels
- **Levels 13-15**: Junior researcher area (explorable today)
- **Level 13**: Has Bronze token on ground (grants access to Levels 7-12)
- **Levels 7-12**: Communal areas (improvise if they explore)
- **Levels 1-6**: Battle damage, ransacked, mostly empty
- **Levels 1-2**: Caved in, tunnel to surface also caved
- **Level 16+**: BLOCKED (Silver-tier token required, they don't have it)

### Quick Level Descriptions
**Level 15**: Dorms, small library (Portal Manual!), rec room (mural of 6 planes)
**Level 14**: Labs, storage (bag of holding, 3 oils of etherealness), archive (weapon rumors), meeting hall
**Level 13**: Nicer dorms, shrine, lounge, advanced library (Plane Shift scroll), Level 12 barrier with Bronze token

### Key Lore They Can Find
- Portal has 6 presets (Hells, Heavens, Feywild, Shadowfell, Astral, Eberron)
- All presets point to remote/safe locations (by design)
- Finding new destinations takes months/years
- Everyone evacuated to Eberron during attack ~1831 years ago
- Low Netheril group proving commoners could rival High Netheril
- Paranoia/security barriers implemented after internal threats
- Dual-wave magic theory (extremely advanced)
- Rumors of weapon project gone wrong (details on lower levels)

### Traps (All Non-Lethal)
**Pranks**: "Free beer" → soap bubbles, whoopee cushion, "get back to work" illusion
**Serious**: Sleep glyph (library), Hold Person (shrine if disrespectful), locked drawer (password "Harmony Eternal")

### Treasure
- Portal Operations Manual
- Bag of holding
- 3 oils of etherealness
- Spell scroll: Plane Shift
- Bronze-tier token (access to Levels 7-12)
- Various research journals/books

## If Players Want to Use Portal

**All 6 presets point to remote wilderness**:
- Would take weeks of travel to reach civilization on any plane
- Not useful until they figure out faster transport
- Safe to explore but time-consuming

**The 6 Planes**:
1. Nine Hells (active) - red desert, nothing for miles
2. Seven Heavens - (improvise peaceful but remote)
3. Feywild - (no time dilation at portal location)
4. Shadowfell - (gloomy, safe but depressing)
5. Astral Plane - (illithid ruins, long-abandoned)
6. Eberron - (wilderness, Netherese evacuees went here but party can't find them easily)

## If Neverember Wants Status Update
- He'll wait patiently while they explore briefly
- After ~30 minutes he'll come looking (curious, not annoyed)
- He's smart enough to realize this is bigger than just a portal
- He'll want to discuss security arrangements
- His specialist team arrives in 3-4 days (from Waterdeep/Neverwinter + 1 day recruitment)

## Active Doom Clocks (Ticking in Background)

**Day 0 = Start of Session 7 (2 days ago in-game)**

**Current Status (Session 8 start, Day 2)**:
- **Facility defenses**: Hardening in progress, 4 more days until complete (Day 6)
- **Owlbear family**: Leaving mountain today as defenses activate
- **Owlbear mama**: Will stay behind in foothills, waiting for party (5 days until Carl messages them)
- **Goblin scouts**: Watching Thunder Mountain (saw bulettes leave, seeing owlbears leave)
- **Redbrands**: Waiting in Phandalin, doing petty crimes, hoping to ambush party when they return
- **Noble B-Team**: Grandma Bean + Songbird's family coordinating (unknown timeline)
- **External Interest**: Facility news spreading slowly (low threat for now)

## Cliffhanger Options (Pick One for ~6pm)

1. **Bronze token found** - Do they explore Levels 7-12 now or head back?
2. **Neverember arrives** - "So... how big is this place?"
3. **Thunder Mountain connection** - Journal hints at weapon mishap northwest
4. **Message from Carl** - (If you want to trigger owlbear thread early)
5. **Inn business question** - Neverember's assistant arrives, needs decisions
6. **Mysterious noise** - From deeper in base (Level 16+)

## Quick NPC Reminders

**Lord Neverember**:  Lawful Good, pragmatic politician, respects competence, rolled nat 20 Insight last session
**Torvald Stone**:    Miner, now level 1 (human male), loyal after portal experience
**Edric Moss**:       Miner, now level 1 (human male), calm under pressure
**Kathra Ironfoot**:  Miner, now level 1 (dwarf female), impressed by party
**Sera Hammerstone**: Foreman, managing excavation, will coordinate inn construction
**Gallio Elibro**:    Innkeeper at Miner's Rest, invested in new inn project

## If Players Go Off-Script

**To Phandalin**:        Redbrands are waiting (ambush possible)
**To Thunder Mountain**: Facility operational, owlbears leaving, defenses hardening
**To other location**:   Improvise or ask "what are you hoping to accomplish?"

## Session Goals

- Let players explore Levels 13-15 (or more if they want)
- Give them the Bronze token (teaches barrier system)
- Provide lore about portal, base history, 6 planes
- Remind them of other plot threads (doom clocks)
- End with decision point: What do they prioritize next?

## Notes

- Players are level 5 (don't level up today)
- Keep it light, explorative, not combat-heavy
- Let them make choices about what to pursue
- No pressure to finish everything - this is a long campaign
- If stuck, Neverember can offer suggestions or ask questions
