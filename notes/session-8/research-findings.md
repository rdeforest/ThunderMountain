# Session 8 Research Findings

## Mind Flayer Planar Origin - RESOLVED

**Answer**: The Astral Plane is correct for the portal preset.

### Canon Lore
- **Original home**: Mind flayers ruled vast empires in the Astral Plane thousands of years ago
- **Flying nautiloids**: Launched from astral domains, could cross between planes to harvest slaves
- **The gith rebellion**: Slave race rose up, destroyed almost all illithid astral domains in less than a year
- **Current location**: Survivors fled to the Underdark on the Material Plane
- **Speculation**: Some illithid realms may still drift in the Astral Plane

### For Portal Preset
The "mind flayer place" that Smol Bean read would be pointing to **the Astral Plane**, specifically to a location that was once (or still is) an illithid domain. This could be:
- Ruins of a destroyed nautiloid city
- A still-functional but abandoned illithid outpost
- A forgotten corner of their former empire

**Robert's decision needed**: Is the preset pointing to ruins or something still inhabited?

## Feywild Time Dilation - VARIABLE, DM'S CHOICE

### 5e 2024 Rules
- **Not fixed speed**: Time dilation varies unpredictably each time someone leaves
- **D20 table exists**: Ranges from extreme compression (days → minutes) to extreme dilation (days → years)
- **DM determines**: Can choose any ratio that works for the campaign
- **Saving throw**: DC 10 Wisdom save to retain memories (Fey and Fey Ancestry auto-succeed)
- **Affects everyone differently**: Time warp is per-group, not universal

### Recommendation for Campaign
Since you want player agency and minimal "gotcha" moments:
- **Option 1**: Warn players about time instability before they go through
- **Option 2**: Have the Netherese preset be to a "stable" Feywild location with minimal drift
- **Option 3**: Make time dilation predictable and reversible (1 day = 1 day unless they stray from the portal location)

## Netherese Construction Styles

### Architectural Overview
- **Highly individualistic**: Each powerful mage "expressed themselves" differently
- **No unified style**: As diverse as art or music styles
- **Common techniques**:
  - Cottage-sized boulders as foundation, magically melded and sculpted
  - Walls of force acting as platters carrying structures
  - Mountain-top enclaves (less common due to unstable rock)

### Social Hierarchy Reflected in Architecture
- **High Netheril**: Flying enclaves miles above surface (nobles)
- **Low Netheril**: Ground settlements called demesnes (commoners)

### Underground Facilities
- **Netherese Caverns example**: Subterranean ruins of ancient city Philock
- **Features**: Tombs, treasure vaults, magical laboratories
- **Design philosophy**: Function follows magical power (practicality secondary to demonstration of ability)

### Construction Materials
- **Primarily stone**: Magically worked and shaped
- **Crystalline elements**: For magical resonance and power storage
- **Mystical metals**: Rare materials for control systems

### For Your Base Design
Since this is a **planar research facility** (proof-of-concept), it would likely be:
- **Utilitarian**: More focused on function than display
- **Heavily warded**: Protection from planar energies
- **Modular**: Chambers for different experiments
- **Library/archive**: Documentation of discoveries
- **Living quarters**: For long research sessions
- **Power systems**: Crystalline resonance enhancement
- **Control room**: Already discovered (the portal chamber)

### Map Resources Found
- **Official**: Netheril: Empire of Magic box set has maps, but focuses on flying cities
- **DMs Guild**: "Netheril Ruin" adventure features subterranean facility maps
- **No perfect match**: Will need to adapt or create custom for planar research station

## Portal Presets - Summary for Robert's Decision

Based on your notes and player responses, here's what we have:

### Confirmed Presets (4 total)
1. **The Nine Hells** (currently active) - Remote desert location, extremely safe due to distance
2. **Feywild** - Unknown specific location (needs defining)
3. **Astral Plane** (the "mind flayer place") - Former illithid territory
4. **(One more to define)** - Shadowfell or Seven Heavens?

### Your Notes Say
- Feywild and Shadowfell are "parallel" to Prime Material (easier to find)
- Hells and Heavens are extremes of alignment (easier to find)
- Players mentioned "three other planes they couldn't describe"

### Contradiction to Resolve
- You said 4 presets total in your notes
- Players said: Feywild, mind flayer place, + 3 unknowns = 5 destinations
- With Hells that's 6 total

**Question for tomorrow**: How many presets total? Which planes are they?

### Suggested Resolution
**6 presets total**:
1. Nine Hells (known, active)
2. Seven Heavens (known to Netherese, unknown to party)
3. Feywild (known to both)
4. Shadowfell (known to Netherese, unknown to party)
5. Astral Plane / mind flayer ruins (partially known to party)
6. *(One wildcard)* - Mechanus? Limbo? Elemental planes?

## Next Steps for Tomorrow Night

### Must Complete
1. **Netherese base layout** - Rooms, encounters, treasures, lore
2. **Portal preset details** - Where exactly does each one go?
3. **NPC team creation** - 4 adventurers + 2 scholars with full character sheets
4. **Doom clock updates** - Current status of all threads
5. **Timeline calculations** - When do NPCs arrive? When do events trigger?

### Nice to Have
1. Session 8 opening scene
2. Cheat sheet for quick reference
3. Update all context files

### Questions for Robert
1. How many portal presets total?
2. Astral preset - ruins or inhabited?
3. Netherese disappearance - keep as canon or drop the thread?
4. How deep/complex should the base be? (1-2 hours exploration or full session?)
5. Any specific Netherese artifacts/magic items you want them to find?
