# Session 7 - What Happened

## Major Events
- Recruited 3 Neutral Good miners (Torvald Stone, Edric Moss, Kathra Ironfoot) to unlock portal
- Successfully activated and tuned the detuned Netherese planar rift
- Explored portal destination: Nine Hells remote desert (safe, extremely far from civilization)
- Discovered hidden door in rift chamber leading to deeper Netherese base
- Pitched Lord Dagult Neverember on investing in new inn
- Negotiated inn deal: Neverember pays construction/staffing (~3k gp budget), party gets 10% profit share + portal security contract
- Accepted Neverember's offer of 5-6 planar specialists team (party directs them)
- Learned portal has 6 presets for different planes
- Confirmed excavation site is full Netherese base, not just mining site

## NPCs Met/Developed
- **Lord Dagult Neverember**: Arrived early to investigate portal, impressed by party competence, rolled nat 20 Insight (understands magnitude), agreed to partner with party
- **Torvald, Edric, Kathra**: Miners leveled to 1 by portal experience, now loyal to party
- **Sera Hammerstone**: Her message brought Neverember, will coordinate inn construction
- **Gallio Elibro**: Invested in inn project, will provide business expertise

## Locations
- Leilon excavation site (20x20x20 portal chamber)

- Portal destination in Nine Hells (scouted)
- Hidden hallway beyond portal chamber (opened but not explored)

## Money/Rewards
- 3 gold each from performing at inn
- 3,000 gp inn investment from Neverember (he pays construction, not a loan)
- Team of 5-6 specialists arriving in 3-4 days
- Full control of portal operations
- Inn location to be built in 2-3 weeks

## Decisions Made
- Keep portal secret (their decision + Neverember's agreement)
- Leave portal pointing at Nine Hells (safest option)
- Commit to inn business
- Accept portal security responsibility
- Instruct miners to keep portal mechanics secret

## Portal System Learned

- Has presets for: Feywild, Hell, Celestial, mind flayer plane (Astral), 3 unknowns
- Powered by planar energy differences
- Can be operated by anyone after unlocking (requires 4 NG people for initial unlock)
- Portal size: 10ft high, 6ft wide at base, 4ft at top (trapezoidal)

## Session End State
- Still in portal chamber with Neverember and 3 miners
- Door to Netherese base open
- 2-3 weeks until inn complete
- 3-4 days until specialist team arrives
- Party has significant social standing in Leilon now
