# Netherese Spiral Base - Levels 13-15
## Session 8 Explorable Area

**Design Philosophy**: Expositive, not deadly. These are "junior researcher" levels - people trusted enough to live here but not access the deeper secrets. Traps are either pranks or serious-but-nonlethal protection for valuable items.

## LEVEL 15 - Entry Level (Portal Hallway Connects Here)

**Description**: The hallway from the portal chamber opens into a wide, gently sloping corridor that curves to follow the spiral. The floor has a 5-degree incline, barely noticeable at first but definitely present. Walls are smooth stone with crystalline veins that no longer glow (unpowered). Netherese script labels doors in a flowing, elegant style.

**Layout**:
- Main spiral corridor (20ft wide)
- 6 dorm rooms (2-person occupancy each)
- 1 communal washroom (magical plumbing, nonfunctional)
- 1 small library/study room
- 1 rec room with game boards still set up mid-game
- Stairway down to Level 16 (BLOCKED by barrier)

**Key Features**:

**Dorm Rooms**:
- Beds (stone frames with long-rotted mattresses)
- Personal effects (clothing dust, writing implements, mundane items)
- One room has a journal on the desk (readable with Comprehend Languages)
  - Details daily life: excitement about getting Level 16 access "someday"
  - Mentions the portal project is "almost ready for first trials"
  - Last entry: "Strange alarm today. Everyone's being evacuated upstairs. Probably another drill."

**Library/Study Room**:
- Bookshelves (many books, most in good condition due to dry air)
- **MAJOR FIND**: "Portal Operations Manual - Public Edition"
  - Explains portal has 6 preset destinations
  - Presets were carefully chosen over years of exploration
  - Finding new safe destinations takes months/years
  - Moving within a known plane takes days of study
  - Safety protocols: Always point to remote/safe locations
  - Warning: "Do not attempt to reach Eberron without authorization"

**Rec Room**:
- Stone tables with game boards carved into surface
- Game pieces scattered (interrupted mid-game)
- Wall mural showing the six planes (crude drawings):
  - Nine Hells (red, fiery)
  - Seven Heavens (golden, clouds)
  - Feywild (green, trees with faces)
  - Shadowfell (gray, gloomy)
  - Astral Plane (silver, floating rocks)
  - Eberron (blue, strange moons, dragons)

**Traps**:
- PRANK: Sign in Netherese near rec room: "FREE BEER →" points to obvious pressure plate
  - Plate triggers harmless illusory ale barrel that sprays soap bubbles
  - Investigation DC 8 to notice plate
- SERIOUS: Library has trapped bookshelf (one valuable tome)
  - Glyph of Warding (sleep spell, not damage)
  - DC 15 Investigation to notice, DC 13 Arcana to disarm
  - Protected book: "Principles of Planar Harmonics" (advanced theory, useful for understanding portal)

**Level 16 Barrier**:
- Crystalline archway, shimmering force field
- Netherese inscription: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY / Silver-Tier Clearance Required / Trust is Earned Through Service / Security Implemented Year 127"
- Slot for token (empty)
- Behind barrier, stairs descend into darkness

## LEVEL 14 - Junior Research Level

**Description**: Larger than Level 15 (spiral expanding), with higher ceilings (12ft vs 10ft). More professional atmosphere - this is where the work happens. The slope continues, making the whole level feel slightly tilted.

**Layout**:
- Main spiral corridor (25ft wide)
- 3 small laboratories
- 1 storage room (general supplies)
- 1 larger meeting/lecture hall
- 1 archive room (records, reports)
- Workshop (tool maintenance, minor fabrication)

**Key Features**:

**Laboratories**:
- Stone workbenches with built-in channels (for runoff)
- Alchemical equipment (glass, metal, all intact)
- Research notes scattered on desks:
  - **Lab 1**: Studies on "resonance harmonics in crystalline matrices"
  - **Lab 2**: Experiments with "planar energy capture and storage"
  - **Lab 3**: "Attempts to weaponize harmonic disruption - SEE LOWER LEVELS FOR RESULTS"
    - This note mentions "catastrophic field test, Year 94" and "project shelved, reoriented toward portal research"

**Storage Room**:
- Shelves of supplies (components, preserved materials)
- Minor treasure: 3 vials of oil of etherealness (still good!)
- Minor treasure: Bag of holding (dusty but functional)

**Meeting/Lecture Hall**:
- Stone benches arranged in semicircle
- Blackboard (slate) with half-erased diagram
- Diagram shows: Two perpendicular wave patterns labeled "Arcane Primary" and "Arcane Secondary"
  - Note: "Like electricity and magnetism, but for magic itself!"
  - "We are the first to discover the second type!"
  - Arcana DC 18: This is genius-level magical theory, far beyond current understanding

**Archive Room**:
- Filing cabinets (stone drawers) with research reports
- **IMPORTANT FIND**: "Incident Report - Year 94"
  - Harmonic weapon test firing
  - Unexpected effect: "Created stable resonance cavity approximately 12 miles northwest"
  - Investigation team couldn't locate the cavity ("must be underground or inside mountain")
  - Project deemed too unpredictable, pivoted to portal research instead
  - DC 15 Intelligence: 12 miles northwest from here = Thunder Mountain
  - DC 18 History: Year 94 in Netherese calendar ≈ -437 DR, about 400 years before Wave Echo Cave was discovered by dwarves

**Workshop**:
- Tools for maintaining equipment
- Mundane items, nothing magical

**Traps**:
- PRANK: Meeting hall has "whoopee cushion" pressure plate on lecturer's spot
  - Triggers loud fart sound (Thaumaturgy cantrip)
- SERIOUS: Archive has magical lock on one drawer
  - DC 15 to pick, or password "Harmony Eternal"
  - Contains the Incident Report (above)

## LEVEL 13 - Upper Barrier Level

**Description**: Slightly larger still. This level houses the barrier to Level 12, which the party approaches from the "wrong" side. This is where researchers passed through going UP after working in the lower communal areas.

**Layout**:
- Main spiral corridor (30ft wide)
- Barrier to Level 12 (with Bronze-tier token nearby!)
- 4 dorm rooms (nicer than Level 15)
- 1 small shrine/meditation room
- 1 lounge area
- 1 additional library (more advanced texts)

**Key Features**:

**Level 12 Barrier** (approaching from below):
- Similar to Level 16 barrier, but Bronze-tier
- Sign: "RESTRICTED ACCESS ABOVE / Bronze-Tier Clearance Required / Communal Areas - Level 12 and Above"
- **MAJOR FIND**: Bronze-tier token lying on ground 10ft from barrier!
  - Token is small crystal disc, engraved with "B-13"
  - Clearly dropped/forgotten during evacuation
  - Grants access to Levels 7-12

**Dorm Rooms**:
- Nicer furnishings (still stone, but carved with decorative elements)
- One room has personal effects: Family portrait (illusion in crystal), shows researcher with two children
- Another room has research journal:
  - "Finally got my Silver-tier access! Can't wait to see what they're working on below!"
  - "Tomorrow I move to Level 17. This is it!"
  - Last entry dated three days before the attack

**Shrine/Meditation Room**:
- Small altar to Mystra (goddess of magic, though Netherese called her Mystryl)
- Offerings long-since decayed
- Peaceful atmosphere
- Wisdom DC 12: Sense of being watched, but not threateningly (just... observed)

**Lounge**:
- Comfortable stone seating (cushions rotted away)
- Bookshelf with non-technical books (fiction, poetry, philosophy)
- One book: "Tales of Eberron: A Traveler's Guide"
  - Describes Eberron as "the safest of our discovered realms"
  - "Should evacuation ever be necessary, Eberron is designated sanctuary"
  - Mentions "marked lightning rail stations" as rendezvous points

**Advanced Library**:
- More technical texts than Level 15
- Books on planar theory, advanced mathematics, resonance theory
- **TREASURE**: Spell scroll of Plane Shift (7th level, very valuable!)
- **LORE BOOK**: "History of Our Organization"
  - Founded by Low Netheril researchers tired of High Netheril politics
  - Built this base in secret over 50 years
  - Goal: "Prove commoners can achieve greatness without floating cities"
  - Eventually discovered by authorities, came under surveillance
  - Paranoia led to implementation of security barriers (Year 127)

**Traps**:
- PRANK: Lounge has illusion trap on a book
  - When opened, projects image of stern researcher saying "GET BACK TO WORK!"
- SERIOUS: Shrine has protective ward
  - Attempting to steal/damage altar triggers Hold Person (DC 14 Wis save)
  - DC 16 Religion to recognize proper respectful approach (bow, offer prayer = safe)

## What They Learn - Summary

By exploring Levels 13-15, the party discovers:

1. **Portal system basics**: 6 presets, how it works, why destinations are remote
2. **The six planes**: Nine Hells, Seven Heavens, Feywild, Shadowfell, Astral, Eberron
3. **Thunder Mountain connection**: This base accidentally created the Wave Echo Cave with a failed weapon test
4. **Evacuation to Eberron**: Everyone went there, explains why base is abandoned
5. **Barrier system**: Need tokens to progress, teaches them the mechanic
6. **Low Netheril origins**: This was a revolutionary group proving commoners could rival High Netheril
7. **Dual-wave magic theory**: Hints at extremely advanced magical understanding
8. **Timeline**: Base attacked ~1831 years ago, same era as Karsus's Folly

## Treasure Summary

- Portal Operations Manual (knowledge)
- 3 vials of oil of etherealness
- Bag of holding
- Spell scroll: Plane Shift
- Various research books (mundane value, scholarly interest)
- Bronze-tier token (grants access to Levels 7-12 for future sessions)

## Suggested Exploration Time

- **Quick run-through**: 45 minutes (hit highlights)
- **Thorough exploration**: 90 minutes (read journals, check every room)
- **Completionist**: 2 hours (investigate traps, study all books, players ask questions)

## Notes for Robert

- Players will probably want to keep exploring up to Levels 1-12 after finding Bronze token
- That's fine! Levels 7-12 can be improvised as "more of the same but communal areas" - dining halls, larger libraries, workshops, training rooms
- Levels 1-6 are battle-damaged and ransacked (quick description, nothing valuable)
- Levels 1-2 are caved in, excavation reveals inclined tunnel to surface (also caved in)

- The Thunder Mountain connection is the big reveal - up to you when/if players realize it
- If they want to go to Eberron through the portal, describe it as "opens into empty wilderness, would take weeks of travel to reach civilization"

- Cliffhanger options:
  1. They find Bronze token, decide whether to explore more or head back to deal with doom clocks
  2. They realize THIS BASE created Thunder Mountain's power source
  3. Neverember is waiting for them topside, wants status update
  4. They receive message from facility via Carl about owlbear situation
