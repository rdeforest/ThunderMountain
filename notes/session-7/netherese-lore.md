# Netherese Lore - Quick Reference

## Timeline

**~2331 years ago**: Netheril at its height
- Flying cities powered by mythallars (massive magical engines)
- Powerful arcanists ruled from sky
- Common folk lived below (Low Netherese vs. High Netherese)

**~1831 years ago (-339 DR)**: Karsus's Folly
- Arcanist Karsus attempted to become god of magic
- Cast 12th level spell (highest ever)
- Succeeded for one moment, then catastrophic failure
- Goddess Mystra sacrificed herself to repair the Weave
- Flying cities crashed, civilization ended
- Most Netherese knowledge lost

**Modern Era**: Remnants and Successors
- Shade Enclave returned 1372 DR (120 years ago)
- Shadovar (shadow-touched Netherese) recently active
- This gives flexibility for "late Netherese" or "Shadovar" dating

## Cultural Characteristics

**Magical Philosophy**:
- Arcane supremacy: magic solved everything
- Ambitious to fatal hubris
- Personal projects over societal good
- Powerful individualist arcanists

**Technology/Magic Style**:
- Mythallar-based power (massive engines)
- Extensive planar research and travel
- Precise geometric magic (complex ritual circles)
- Crystal/resonance technology (matrices for power/control)
- Modular, interlocking enchantment systems

**Social Structure**:
- Extreme stratification
- Elite arcanists (High Netherese) in flying cities
- Common folk (Low Netherese) on ground
- Personal magical might = social status

## Why They'd Build a Planar Rift Chamber

**Plausible Motivations**:
1. Planar transportation network (bypass Material Plane)
2. Research station (study planar mechanics)
3. Resource extraction (access planar energies/materials)
4. Escape route (safety when city crashed)
5. Pure hubris ("We can control ANY plane!")

**Most Likely**: Personal arcanist research project that outlived creator

## Language & Writing

**Loross**: Netherese language
- Complex written form
- Uses geometric/mathematical notation for magic
- Not commonly known in 1492 DR
- Arcana checks can interpret magical diagrams even without language fluency

## Connection to Baldur's Gate 3

**Crown of Karsus**: Featured in BG3, especially Gale's storyline
**Mystra's Sacrifice**: Central to BG3 plot
**Netherese Artifacts**: Common in modern Forgotten Realms stories

## Why This Chamber Survived

1. **Built into bedrock** (not in flying city that crashed)
2. **Self-contained systems** (didn't rely on mythallar)
3. **Warning symbols worked** (people stayed away)
4. **Sheer luck**

## Typical Netherese Magic Style

**Characteristics**:
- Permanent enchantments preferred over consumables
- Geometric precision in design
- Crystalline components for power storage/transmission
- Modular systems (components work independently and together)
- Ambitious scale (nothing small or simple)

**Example**: This rift chamber
- 5-part geometric system (cube with 4 walls + floor)
- Crystalline resonance control
- Self-sustaining for centuries
- Complex but elegant operation

## DM Usage Notes

**For Players**:
- Netherese = ancient, powerful, dangerous, hubristic
- Their stuff still works after millennia (scary impressive)
- Usually comes with warnings (heed them!)
- Ambitious magic often has catastrophic failure modes

**For Worldbuilding**:
- Netherese ruins explain "why is this ancient magic here?"
- Their fall explains "why isn't everyone this powerful?"
- Flexible dating (early vs. late vs. Shadovar) helps retcon
- Their planar research justifies almost any weird planar effect

## Quick Comparison: Netherese vs. Dwarven/Gnomish

| Aspect | Netherese | Dwarven/Gnomish (Facility) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Age** | ~1831 years | ~500 years |
| **Power Source** | Mythallar or planar | Crystalline resonance (local) |
| **Style** | Geometric, arcane | Mechanical, practical |
| **Scale** | Grandiose, ambitious | Purpose-built, efficient |
| **Failure Mode** | Catastrophic | Graceful degradation |
| **Social** | Individual arcanist | Collaborative crafters |

**In Chamber**: Netherese built the rift controls for research/transportation
**In Facility**: Dwarves/gnomes built practical forge for item creation

Both use crystalline resonance but applied differently:
- Netherese: Control planar boundaries
- Facility: Extract/channel local energy

## If Players Ask Historical Questions

**"Why did Netheril fall?"**
- Hubris. Karsus tried to become god of magic.
- It worked for a moment, then failed catastrophically.
- Flying cities crashed, most knowledge lost.

**"Are there other Netherese ruins?"**
- Yes, scattered across Faerûn.
- Most are buried, dangerous, or picked clean.
- This chamber survived because it was sealed and stable.

**"Could this happen again?"**
- Unlikely. Magic users learned from Karsus's mistake.
- Mystra (goddess of magic) now prevents 10th+ level spells.
- But Netherese artifacts can still malfunction spectacularly.

**"Who built THIS specifically?"**
- Unknown. Probably individual arcanist's project.
- No identifying marks (unusual - arcanists loved signatures).
- Suggests: secret project, research station, or failure they didn't want credit for.

## Pronunciation Guide

**Netheril**: NETH-er-il (emphasis on first syllable)
**Karsus**: KAR-sus (like "car" + "sus")
**Loross**: LOR-oss (Netherese language)
**Mythallar**: mith-AL-ar (emphasis on middle)
**Shadovar**: SHAD-oh-var (shadow-touched Netherese)
