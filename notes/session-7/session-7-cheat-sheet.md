# Session 7 Cheat Sheet - Quick Reference

## Opening
"You're standing outside the chamber, holding a warm javelin that smells of sulfur. What do you do?"

## Rift Chamber Basics
- **20x20x20 cube**, rift at center (~7ft radius, oversized from neglect)
- **Psychic wrongness**: Rift feedback harmonics (detuned = reality tears)
- **Current destination**: Hell-pocket, uninhabited, hostile environment
- **Netherese warnings** carved on walls (Loross language + diagrams)

## If They Investigate Chamber

**Wisdom DC 12**: Notice subtle markings at 4 corners
**Arcana DC 15**: Understand diagrams (need 4 people at corners to unlock)
**Arcana DC 18**: Recognize Netherese geometric precision

## If They Enter Detuned Rift

**CON save DC 12** every 10 min or 1d6 heat/toxic damage
- Red sky, oppressive heat, barren rock, sulfur smell
- Nothing to find (pocket dimension, empty)
- Rift visible from other side (can return safely)
- Shearing effect visible (rock got cut in half)

## Unlocking Controls (Hidden Alignment Test)

**Requirement**: 4 people simultaneously touch corners
**Hidden test**: Reads recent memories/actions (NG required)
- Smol: CN but recent good acts might pass
- Songbird: Likely passes
- **Need 2 more NG from Leilon**

**Success**: Controls emerge from walls at all 4 corners
**Failure**: Nothing happens, need different person

## After Unlock - Operating

**Any 1 person** can operate (alignment doesn't matter after unlock)
**Performance or Arcana check** to tune destination:
- 20+: Perfect (crystal clear, safe)
- 15-19: Stable (slightly hazy, safe)
- 10-14: Functional (distorted, CON save or 1d6 on passage)
- 5-9: Unstable (wrong destination/void)
- <5: Dangerous (shearing, catastrophe)

**Visual feedback** shows quality BEFORE committing
**10 minutes** per tuning attempt

## Leilon NPCs (If Needed)

**Sera Hammerstone** (dwarven foreman):
- Pragmatic, concerned about workers
- Offers 15gp + bonus for solving rift
- Can provide worker NPCs if asked
- Impressed by competence

**Gallio** (Miner's Rest innkeeper):
- Hired Songbird for weekly performances
- Friendly, welcoming
- Knows town gossip

**Random workers**: Mostly good-aligned, willing to help if asked nicely

## Cliffhanger Options

1. **Figure out operation** → leave them with controls unlocked, wondering about destinations
2. **Leave town** → bandit ambush on road, end mid-combat
3. **Start inn business** → "A messenger arrives from Never Ember's office..."
4. **6pm bailout** → Never Ember arrives unannounced (inspection early!)
5. **Discovery** → Connect Netherese foundation to Thunder Mountain facility

## Key Worldbuilding (If Asked)

**Netherese**: Ancient magical civilization, fell ~1831 years ago (hubris), built this chamber for planar research/transport

**Why survived**: Underground, self-contained, people heeded warnings

**Connection to facility**: Netherese enhanced Thunder Mountain's geology/resonance originally, dwarves/gnomes built on it 500 years ago

**Purpose**: Proof-of-concept portal (smaller version), larger one didn't survive

## Quick Mechanics Reference

**Wisdom saves**: Notice things, perception
**Arcana checks**: Understand magic, recognize symbols
**Performance checks**: Vocal/musical tuning of resonance
**CON saves**: Resist environmental damage

## Session Goals

✓ Players explore rift chamber
✓ Discover unlock mechanism (or enter detuned rift)
✓ Create hook back to town (need NPCs) OR
✓ Advance one of their own agendas (inn, performance, etc.)
✓ End on cliffhanger that works for 2-week break

## Remember

- Ad-lib recap (you got this)
- Keep it flexible - follow their lead
- Multiple valid paths forward
- Cliffhanger by 6pm latest
- Have fun!
