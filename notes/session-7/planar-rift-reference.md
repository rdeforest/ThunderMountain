# Planar Rift - Session 7 Reference

**Location**:     Leilon excavation site, Netherese chamber
**Party Status**: Level 5, just poked rift with javelin (warm, sulfur smell)

## Quick Facts

**Age**:           ~1831 years old (Netherese, pre-fall around -339 DR)
**Current State**: Detuned, oversized from neglect, pointing to hell-adjacent pocket dimension
**Danger Level**:  Medium (hostile environment beyond, no immediate devils)
**Normal Size**:   Much smaller when properly tuned/maintained
**Stability**:     Designed for years of neglect, not centuries - showing its age

## The Chamber

**Dimensions**:    20x20x20 foot cube
**Rift Location**: Center, ~7ft radius sphere (should be smaller)
**Symbols**:       Netherese warning glyphs (Loross language)
**Feeling**:       "Two universes grinding together" - psychic wrongness from rift feedback harmonics (tears at reality)

## What It Currently Connects To

**Destination**: Hell-adjacent pocket dimension (uninhabited)

- Red-tinged sky, oppressive heat
- Barren rocky landscape
- Toxic/hostile environment (CON saves required)
- NO devils or organized resistance
- Rift visible from other side (can return)

**Why detuned**: Like AM radio drifted off-station - pointing vaguely toward hells but not properly locked

## The Control System - "Resonance Choir"

### Physical Setup

- **4 control stations** Each corner has controls which can be revealed by
  four people standing in each corner, each touching each wall in a specific
  location.

- **Alignment lock**: 4 Neutral Good people required to UNLOCK controls (hidden test)
- **Operation**: After unlock, 1 person (any alignment) can operate
- **Netherese instructions** carved on walls (Loross + diagrams)
- **Crystals**: Hidden inside walls, not directly visible

### How It Works
**Unlocking** (one-time, reveals controls):
1. **4 people stand at corners**, each touching wall at specific location
2. **Alignment test** (hidden): Must be Neutral Good or close
3. **Controls emerge** from walls when all 4 pass test simultaneously

**Operating** (after unlock):
1. **1 operator** uses revealed controls (any alignment)
2. **Performance or Arcana check** to tune destination (DC varies)
3. **Lights/resonance feedback** show tuning quality (visual/auditory)
4. **Visual preview** of destination before committing
5. **Process takes ~10 minutes** per attempt

### Why This Design
- **Geometric**: 4 corners, maximum distance from center (~14 feet)
- **Still uses resonance** (fundamental principle, crystals hidden in walls)
- **Requires NPC recruitment** (4 NG people to unlock)
- **Netherese-appropriate** (geometric precision, crystalline magic, planar research)
- **Proof of concept**: Smaller version - larger portal chamber didn't survive centuries
- **Survived because underground** (not in flying city)

## Tuning Mechanics

### The Process
1. **Choose destination** (if known) OR **scan for signals** (reveals nearby planar signatures)
2. **Operator makes check** (Performance or Arcana, DC varies by destination)
3. **Result** determines tuning quality
4. **Visual feedback shows quality** BEFORE committing
5. **Players decide**: Go through, or try again (10min reset)

### Tuning Quality Table
| Average Roll | Result | Safety | Visual |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 20+ | Perfect | Completely safe | Crystal clear view of destination |
| 15-19 | Stable | Safe passage | Slightly hazy but clear |
| 10-14 | Functional | Risky (CON save or 1d6 damage) | Distorted, colors off |
| 5-9 | Unstable | Wrong destination or interplanar void | Swirling chaos |
| <5 | Dangerous | Shearing effect, possible catastrophe | Violent distortion |

### Potential Destinations
- **Material Plane locations** (if coordinates learned)
- **Nine Hells layers** (currently closest signal)
- **Other planes** (requires research/instruction manuals)
- **"Nowhere"** (closing the rift - DC 20+ from operator)

### Special Case: Current Plane
**Cannot tune to Material Plane in this region** - rift requires power differential between planes.

**To restart if tuned to current plane**: Would require MASSIVE energy input (facility-scale power)

## The Alignment Lock (Hidden Mechanic - For Unlocking Only)

**Requirement**: 4 Neutral Good people to unlock controls (one-time)

**Test Method** (invisible to players):
When character touches corner wall location, reads recent memories/intentions:
- Helped others without reward? ✓
- Harmed innocents? ✗
- Recent good deeds count more than alignment label

**Failure State**:
- Controls don't emerge from wall
- Can try different corner
- If person fails at ALL corners, they're locked out
- Must find NG-aligned helper from town

**Success State**:
- When all 4 corners have NG person simultaneously, controls emerge
- Controls remain revealed (don't need to re-unlock)
- Anyone can then OPERATE the revealed controls

**Party Alignment Check**:
- **Smol Bean**: Chaotic Neutral (might work if recent good actions lean good)
- **Songbird**: Likely Good-aligned (diplomatic, helpful approach)
- **Need 2 more NG people** from Leilon townsfolk to unlock

## Information Sources

### In The Chamber
**Netherese carvings**:
- Diagrams showing 4 people at corners to unlock
- Geometric/resonance symbols for operation
- 3-4 destination "addresses" in Netherese notation
- Warning glyphs (dangers of improper tuning, rift feedback harmonics)

**Translation**:
- Songbird doesn't speak Loross
- Smol can translate with Arcana check (recognizes magical notation)
- Diagrams are mostly self-explanatory

### Wizard's Notes (if searched)
- How to unlock the controls
- Tuning system
- Partial research on closure options
- Notes on Spellplague effects (wasn't what destroyed Leilon, but made rift less stable)

### Facility Connection (future)
- Might have related planar research
- Detection of "something significant" miles away during tuning
- Possible power source for emergency restart

## Netherese Background (If Asked)

**Who Were They?**
- Ancient magical civilization (~1831 years ago)
- Built flying cities powered by mythallars
- Hubris destroyed them (Karsus's Folly)
- Tried to become god of magic, catastrophically failed
- Most cities crashed, civilization ended

**Why Build This?**
- Planar transportation network
- Research station for planar mechanics
- Personal arcanist project
- Loved complex geometric magic and crystalline systems

**Why It Survived**:
- Built into bedrock (not flying city)
- Self-contained systems
- Warning symbols kept people away
- Dumb luck

## Environmental Dangers (If They Enter)

**Current Destination** (detuned hell-pocket):
- **Heat**: Oppressive, draining (CON saves)
- **Air**: Toxic/sulfurous (CON saves)
- **Terrain**: Barren rock, no resources
- **Time Limit**: Minutes before serious danger

**Well-Tuned Destination**:
- No shearing effect
- Clear view before entry
- Environmental dangers depend on destination

**Poorly-Tuned**:
- Shearing damage on passage
- Might lead to interplanar void
- Could dump in wrong location entirely

## DM Notes

### Key Principles
- **No time travel** (rule #1)
- **Encourages town engagement** (need NPC operators)
- **Player choice emphasized** (can see quality before committing)
- **Complexity scales over sessions** (discovery → experimentation → mastery)

### Session Pacing
- **Session 7**: Discovery of controls, alignment testing, need for operators
- **Session 8**: Recruitment, experimentation, first successful tune
- **Session 9**: Actual use or connection to facility

### Flexibility Built In
- Can add new destinations as needed
- Research can be found anywhere plausible
- Rift can shift destinations naturally over time
- Failure creates interesting problems, not TPK

### Connection to Facility
- **Netherese foundation**: Thunder Mountain's geology/resonance was originally enhanced by Netherese
- **Dwarves/gnomes discovered it**: Built facility on top of ancient Netherese groundwork ~500 years ago
- **Same principles, different applications**: Both use crystalline resonance
- **Detection**: Facility tuning detected rift's signature (distance: day+ walk)
- **No direct power connection**: Separate systems built on same foundation
- **Future hook**: Facility might help restart rift if tuned to current plane

## Quick Reference for Tomorrow

**Opening**: "You're standing outside the chamber, holding a warm javelin that smells of sulfur. What do you do?"

**If they investigate chamber more**:
- Wisdom check to notice markings at corners (where to touch)
- Arcana check to understand Netherese diagrams (4 people needed)
- Touching corner locations triggers alignment test (hidden, need 4 NG simultaneously)

**If they enter rift**:
- CON save DC 12 every 10 minutes or take 1d6 heat/toxic damage
- Describe hostile environment
- Rift visible from other side
- Nothing to find (pocket dimension, empty)
- Return is obvious option

**If they report to Sera**:
- She's impressed, concerned
- Asks what they recommend
- Offers continued employment
- Can provide worker NPCs if needed

**Cliffhanger options**:
- Successfully identify need 4 NG people to unlock (recruit from town)
- Unlock controls but first tuning attempt produces unexpected result
- Something comes THROUGH from other side (minor elemental? rift destabilization?)
- Discover Netherese foundation connection to Thunder Mountain facility
