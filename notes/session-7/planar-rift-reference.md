# Planar Rift - Session 7 Reference
**Location**: Leilon excavation site, Netherese chamber
**Party Status**: Level 5, just poked rift with javelin (warm, sulfur smell)

## Quick Facts

**Age**: ~1831 years old (Netherese, pre-fall around -339 DR)
**Current State**: Detuned, oversized from neglect, pointing to hell-adjacent pocket dimension
**Danger Level**: Medium (hostile environment beyond, no immediate devils)
**Normal Size**: Much smaller when properly tuned/maintained
**Stability**: Designed for years of neglect, not centuries - showing its age

## The Chamber

**Dimensions**: 20x20x20 foot cube
**Rift Location**: Center, ~7ft radius sphere (should be smaller)
**Symbols**: Netherese warning glyphs (Loross language)
**Feeling**: "Two universes grinding together" - psychic wrongness

## What It Currently Connects To

**Destination**: Hell-adjacent pocket dimension (uninhabited)
- Red-tinged sky, oppressive heat
- Barren rocky landscape
- Toxic/hostile environment (CON saves required)
- NO devils or organized resistance
- Rift visible from other side (can return)

**Why detuned**: Like AM radio drifted off-station - pointing vaguely toward hells but not properly locked

## The Control System - "Resonance Choir"

### Physical Setup
- **5 Resonance Pedestals** (4 walls + floor center)
- Each has **tuning crystal** at different color/frequency
- **Alignment lock**: Pedestals only respond to Neutral Good operators (hidden test)
- **Netherese instructions** carved on walls (Loross + diagrams)

### How It Works
1. **5 operators stand at pedestals** (4-5 people required)
2. **Hum/sing to match crystal frequency** (Performance or Arcana check)
3. **Crystals glow brighter** when closer to correct frequency (visual feedback)
4. **All 5 must be in harmony** simultaneously to lock destination
5. **Process takes ~10 minutes** to attempt

### Why This Design
- Different from facility (vocal vs. console)
- Still uses resonance (fundamental principle)
- Requires NPC recruitment (encourages town engagement)
- Netherese-appropriate (geometric precision + crystalline magic)
- Creates coordination gameplay

## Tuning Mechanics

### The Process
1. **Choose destination** (if known) OR **scan for signals** (reveals nearby planar signatures)
2. **All 5 operators make check** (Performance or Arcana, DC varies by destination)
3. **Average results** determine tuning quality
4. **Visual feedback shows quality** BEFORE committing
5. **Players decide**: Go through, or try again (10min reset)

### Tuning Quality Table
| Average Roll | Result | Safety | Visual |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 20+ | Perfect | Completely safe | Crystal clear view of destination |
| 15-19 | Stable | Safe passage | Slightly hazy but clear |
| 10-14 | Functional | Risky (CON save or 1d6 damage) | Distorted, colors off |
| 5-9 | Unstable | Wrong destination or interplanar void | Swirling chaos |
| <5 | Dangerous | Shearing effect, possible catastrophe | Violent distortion |

### Potential Destinations
- **Material Plane locations** (if coordinates learned)
- **Nine Hells layers** (currently closest signal)
- **Other planes** (requires research/instruction manuals)
- **"Nowhere"** (closing the rift - DC 20+ from all operators)

### Special Case: Current Plane
**Cannot tune to Material Plane in this region** - rift requires power differential between planes.

**To restart if tuned to current plane**: Would require MASSIVE energy input (facility-scale power)

## The Alignment Lock (Hidden Mechanic)

**Requirement**: Operators must be Neutral Good (or close enough)

**Test Method** (invisible to players):
Pedestal reads recent memories/intentions when touched:
- Helped others without reward? ✓
- Harmed innocents? ✗
- Recent good deeds count more than alignment label

**Failure State**:
- Crystal doesn't glow in response to voice
- Can try different pedestal
- If NONE work, character is locked out
- Must find NG-aligned helper from town

**Party Alignment Check**:
- **Smol Bean**: Chaotic Neutral (might work if recent good actions)
- **Songbird**: Likely Good-aligned (diplomatic, helpful approach)
- **Need 3 more operators** from Leilon townsfolk

## Information Sources

### In The Chamber
**Netherese carvings**:
- Diagrams showing 5 operators at positions
- Musical notation-like symbols for each crystal
- Color coding (matches crystal colors)
- 3-4 destination "addresses" in Netherese notation
- Warning glyphs (dangers of improper tuning)

**Translation**:
- Kyle doesn't speak Loross
- Smol can translate with Arcana check (recognizes magical notation)
- Diagrams are mostly self-explanatory

### Wizard's Notes (if searched)
- Partial research on closure attempts
- 1-2 additional destinations discovered
- Notes on Spellplague effects (wasn't what destroyed Leilon, but made rift less stable)

### Facility Connection (future)
- Might have related planar research
- Detection of "something significant" miles away during tuning
- Possible power source for emergency restart

## Netherese Background (If Asked)

**Who Were They?**
- Ancient magical civilization (~1831 years ago)
- Built flying cities powered by mythallars
- Hubris destroyed them (Karsus's Folly)
- Tried to become god of magic, catastrophically failed
- Most cities crashed, civilization ended

**Why Build This?**
- Planar transportation network
- Research station for planar mechanics
- Personal arcanist project
- Loved complex geometric magic and crystalline systems

**Why It Survived**:
- Built into bedrock (not flying city)
- Self-contained systems
- Warning symbols kept people away
- Dumb luck

## Environmental Dangers (If They Enter)

**Current Destination** (detuned hell-pocket):
- **Heat**: Oppressive, draining (CON saves)
- **Air**: Toxic/sulfurous (CON saves)
- **Terrain**: Barren rock, no resources
- **Time Limit**: Minutes before serious danger

**Well-Tuned Destination**:
- No shearing effect
- Clear view before entry
- Environmental dangers depend on destination

**Poorly-Tuned**:
- Shearing damage on passage
- Might lead to interplanar void
- Could dump in wrong location entirely

## DM Notes

### Key Principles
- **No time travel** (rule #1)
- **Encourages town engagement** (need NPC operators)
- **Player choice emphasized** (can see quality before committing)
- **Complexity scales over sessions** (discovery → experimentation → mastery)

### Session Pacing
- **Session 7**: Discovery of controls, alignment testing, need for operators
- **Session 8**: Recruitment, experimentation, first successful tune
- **Session 9**: Actual use or connection to facility

### Flexibility Built In
- Can add new destinations as needed
- Research can be found anywhere plausible
- Rift can shift destinations naturally over time
- Failure creates interesting problems, not TPK

### Connection to Facility
- **Minimal but present**: Both use resonance, different applications
- **Detection**: Facility tuning detected rift's signature (distance: day+ walk)
- **No power connection**: Separate phenomena
- **Future hook**: Facility might help restart if tuned to current plane

## Quick Reference for Tomorrow

**Opening**: "You're standing outside the chamber, holding a warm javelin that smells of sulfur. What do you do?"

**If they investigate chamber more**:
- Wisdom check to notice pedestals blend into walls
- Arcana check to understand Netherese diagrams
- Touching pedestal triggers alignment test (hidden)

**If they enter rift**:
- CON save DC 12 every 10 minutes or take 1d6 heat/toxic damage
- Describe hostile environment
- Rift visible from other side
- Nothing to find (pocket dimension, empty)
- Return is obvious option

**If they report to Sera**:
- She's impressed, concerned
- Asks what they recommend
- Offers continued employment
- Can provide worker NPCs if needed

**Cliffhanger options**:
- Successfully identify control system but realize need 5 people
- First attempt at tuning produces unexpected result
- Something comes THROUGH from other side (minor elemental?)
- Facility connection detected during scan
