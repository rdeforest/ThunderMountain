# The Forge of Echoing Thunder - Operations Manual

## Power Requirements
- **Minimum**: 2 crystals (basic operation - can do one enhancement)
- **Standard**: 3 crystals (normal operation - full features)
- **Maximum**: 5 crystals (overclock - experimental features)
- **Current Status**: 1 crystal installed, need 1 more for trumpet enhancement

## Forge Personalities (Based on Crystal Selection)

### Red Crystal - "The Enthusiast"
- Suggests "improvements" without being asked
- Occasionally refuses boring requests: "A plain dagger? BORING! Let's add FIRE!"
- Success rate: 90% (rolls d10, on 1 it adds random property)
- Voice: Excitable, interrupts itself

### Blue Crystal - "The Perfectionist"
- Demands exact specifications: "Define 'sharp'. Molecular edge? Monomolecular?"
- Products are flawless but process is tedious
- Success rate: 100% but takes twice as long
- Voice: Monotone, pedantic

### Green Crystal - "The Dreamer"
- Adds unexpected features: "I included a tea warmer function!"
- Experimental approach to everything
- Success rate: 85% but always includes something extra
- Voice: Distracted, tangential

### Cracked Yellow Crystal - "The Glitch"
- Works but... oddly
- Random surges cause cosmetic oddities
- Success rate: 95% but products look weird
- Voice: Cuts out mid-sentence, stutters

## Enhancement Process

### Step 1: Placement
- Item goes on the Resonance Anvil
- Anvil scans and identifies item type
- Forge announces what it detects

### Step 2: Intent Declaration
- User states desired enhancement
- Forge personality responds based on crystal
- May negotiate or suggest alternatives

### Step 3: Harmonic Attunement
- Striker (anyone) hits anvil in specific pattern
- Pattern complexity based on enhancement difficulty
- Performance check DC 10-15 (advantage if proficient with smith's tools)

### Step 4: Enhancement
- Item levitates, surrounded by thunder energy
- Duration: 1-10 minutes based on complexity
- Visible/audible effects based on crystal type

## The Songbird's Trumpet Enhancement

### What The Forge Says
"Ah! A Bronzevoice training trumpet! Excellent harmonic reception matrices. Already tuned for echo enhancement. Shall we add the Fate Echo protocol? Standard enhancement, very popular with bards."

### Required Pattern
- Three strikes: DONG... dong-dong... DONG
- Timing matters: Songbird can use Performance check
- Smol can assist with her soldier background

### Visual Effect
- Trumpet floats, spinning slowly
- Blue lightning traces musical staves in the air
- The lightning forms the musical notation for "Echoes of Fate"
- Everyone hears both the original melody and its echo

## Current Limitations

### Missing Component (Unknown)
- Forge can't do more than one enhancement per item
- System reports: "Enhancement Multiplexer: NOT FOUND"
- This component exists in the incomplete second forge area
- Would allow multiple enhancements on single item

### Personality Conflicts
If multiple crystal types installed:
- Personalities argue with each other
- Roll d6 to see which one is dominant each use
- Can spend 10 minutes "negotiating" for specific personality

### Power Conservation Mode
Due to facility damage:
- Can only enhance 3 items per day
- Larger items count as multiple uses
- Needs 1 hour cooldown between uses

## Special Interactions

### Carl + Trumpet Resonance
When within 30ft of each other:
- Both vibrate subtly (disadvantage on Stealth)
- Can "ping" each other (locate within 120ft)
- If used together: Create 10ft radius silence field for 1 round (once per day)

### Forge Memory
The forge remembers:
- Every item it has ever enhanced
- Can identify its own work from centuries ago
- Will comment on "family resemblance" if it enhanced ancestors' items

## Emergency Protocols
If enhancement fails:
- "ENHANCEMENT FAILURE. ITEM INTACT. PLEASE RECALIBRATE."
- Item is unchanged, can try again
- Crystal might need "percussive maintenance" (hit it)

## Future Upgrades
When facility fully repaired:
- Batch processing (multiple items)
- Enhancement removal/transfer
- Item repair/restoration
- Recreation from "memory" (if original was forged here)
