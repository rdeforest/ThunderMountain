# Encounter: The Echo Gallery (Exit 3)

## Description
Series of resonance chambers for testing forged items' sonic properties. Still "live" after centuries.

## SPECIAL MECHANIC: Chaos Rerolls
When ANYONE (including NPCs) rolls a d20 in the Gallery:
- DM rolls d10
- On 1: Roll with disadvantage (echo distortion)
- On 10: Roll with advantage (echo amplification)
- Trumpet doesn't use charges (powered by chamber)

## Thunder Mephit Colony
Small elementals born from decades of thunder echoes.

### Thunder Mephit Stats (Modified Dust Mephit)
- **HP**: 17 each (4 total)

- **Thunder Breath**: 15ft cone, 2d4 thunder damage (recharge 6)
- **Innate Casting**: Thunderwave 1/day

## Chamber Progression

### Chamber 1: The Tuning Hall
- **Puzzle**: Three tuning forks, must be struck in sequence
- **Clue**: Musical notes carved in Dwarvish on wall
- **Failure**: Thunderwave effect on whole party
- **Success**: Opens path forward

### Chamber 2: The Resonance Maze
- **Challenge**: Multiple paths, only one doesn't trigger echoes
- **Sound Check**: Stealth DC 13 or trigger mephit attention
- **Trick**: Complete silence (magical or holding breath) bypasses

### Chamber 3: The Echo Arena
- **Combat**: 2-3 mephits attack here
- **Environmental**: Every attack creates echo (5ft push effect)
- **Chandelier**: Can be dropped with successful ranged attack

### Chamber 4: The Harmony Bridge
- **Challenge**: Invisible bridge appears when correct note is played/sung
- **Alternative**: Acrobatics DC 15 to jump gaps
- **Failure**: Fall into mephit nest (all 4 present)

### Chamber 5: The Silent Sanctum
- **Boss**: Thunder Mephit Sovereign (25 HP, can cast Shatter)
- **Twist**: It's actually peaceful if approached without weapons
- **Negotiation**: Wants the "noise" to stop (means the forge)

## Sound-Based Puzzle Solutions
1. **Cover ears**: Reduces thunder damage by half
2. **Create opposing sound**: Cancel out specific frequencies
3. **Whisper only**: Mephits can't hear below certain volume
4. **Rhythm matching**: Move in time with echo pulses

## Environmental Details
- **Glowing Acoustic Crystals**: Provide dim light, hum constantly
- **Echo Delay**: All verbal communication has 1-second delay
- **Sound Mirrors**: Curved walls that redirect sonic attacks
- **Resonance Points**: Standing here amplifies all sound-based effects

## Treasure
- **Echo Stone**: Can record and play back 1 minute of sound
- **Mephit Dust**: Material component for thunder spells (worth 100gp)
- **Tuning Fork Set**: Different planes' frequencies (planar travel focus)
- **Acoustic Map**: Shows all Thunder Mountain's resonance chambers

## Exit Location
- Emerges near old Cragmaw mines
- Cragmaw scouts might be investigating
- 12 miles from Phandalin
- Exit is one-way (sound barrier prevents re-entry)

## Failure Consequences
- **Too much noise**: All mephits converge (difficult fight)
- **Deafness**: Temporary but problematic for communication
- **Structural damage**: Ceiling collapse, need to dig out

## Success Rewards
- **Mephit Alliance**: They'll guard this entrance if treated well
- **Sound Mastery**: Advantage on Performance checks for 24 hours
- **Quick Exit**: Fastest route if solved efficiently

## Songbird's Special Moment
When trumpet auto-plays here:
- Creates visible sound waves
- Mephits stop and listen in awe
- Can potentially skip entire combat
- Sovereign offers to teach "Thunder Song" (new bard spell)
