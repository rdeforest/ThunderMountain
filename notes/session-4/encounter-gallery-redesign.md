# Encounter: Resonance Testing Bay (Redesigned Echo Gallery)

## What This Chamber Actually Is
A quality control testing facility where forged items were checked for proper harmonic resonance. Single large chamber with sophisticated acoustic engineering.

## Physical Layout (Makes Engineering Sense!)

### Chamber Features
- **Parabolic Focusing Dishes**: 6 acoustic reflectors on walls (like satellite dishes)
- **Testing Pedestals**: 3 raised platforms at calculated harmonic nodes
- **Emergency Exit**: One-way acoustic valve at far end (clever dwarven engineering)
- **Control Panel**: Damaged but readable, shows wave interference patterns
- **Blue Traces**: Lead to each pedestal and the exit

### Why It Exists
Original purpose: Test if forged items had correct resonance frequency
- Items placed on pedestals
- Chamber generates test tones
- Acoustic dishes focus sound to measure response
- Pass/fail based on interference patterns

## Current Problem: Thunder Mephits

### The Mephits (4 total)
- Nesting in the parabolic dishes
- Their presence disrupts the harmonic frequencies
- Chamber constantly reverberates at wrong frequency
- Creates disorienting acoustic environment

### Mephit Behavior
- Not immediately hostile (they like the acoustics)
- Will attack if their dishes are threatened
- Can be negotiated with (they want music)
- Sovereign nests in largest dish

## The Engineering Puzzle (Thunder Will Appreciate This!)

### The Physics Problem
**Current State**: Chaotic acoustic interference
- Multiple frequencies bouncing randomly
- Creates "pressure zones" of intense sound
- Need to restore proper standing wave pattern

### The Solution: Destructive Interference
Create a null point at the exit using three resonance sources:

1. **Pedestal A**: Needs Carl (familiar resonates at specific frequency)
2. **Pedestal B**: Needs Trumpet (different frequency after enhancement)  
3. **Pedestal C**: Needs third resonant object (creative solution required)

### How It Works (Actual Physics!)
- Each pedestal generates standing wave
- Correct positioning creates destructive interference at exit
- Wrong combination = constructive interference (damage)
- Visual: Can see wave patterns in dust/mist

### Finding the Solution
**Control Panel Clues**:
- Shows three sine waves
- Indicates phase relationships needed
- One screen shows "CALIBRATION REQUIRED"

**Trial and Error Method**:
- Each wrong attempt: 1d4 thunder damage to all
- Can deduce pattern from which combinations hurt most/least
- Investigation DC 13 to understand the diagram

**Smart Solution**:
- Songbird's musical knowledge (Performance check DC 12)
- Thunder's engineering background (Investigation advantage)
- Use Prestidigitation to visualize sound waves

## Combat Alternative: Negotiate with Mephits

### What Mephits Want
- Sovereign speaks broken Common
- "We like the BOOM-BOOM place"
- "You make pretty sounds, we show exit"
- Want Songbird to play concert

### Mephit Concert
If Songbird performs:
- Performance DC 15 for excellent show
- Success: Mephits guide to exit
- Critical Success: Sovereign teaches "Thunder Note" cantrip
- Failure: Mephits disappointed but not hostile

## Environmental Mechanics

### Disorientation Effect
While frequencies are wrong:
- CON save DC 12 each minute
- Failure: Disadvantage on all rolls for 1 minute
- Acoustic pressure causes mild nausea

### Movement Challenges
- Certain zones have "standing wave walls"
- Like invisible force fields
- STR check DC 13 to push through
- Or find null points to walk around

## Emergency Exit Mechanism

### The Acoustic Valve
Dwarven engineering marvel:
- One-way sound barrier
- Allows exit but not entry
- Silent on other side
- Opens only when chamber is at null frequency

### If They Force It
- STR DC 25 to break
- Damages the mechanism
- Alerts everything within 1 mile
- Facility marks this as "vandalism"

## Rewards for Clever Solution

### If Solved Properly
- Understanding of acoustic engineering
- Mephits become allies
- Access to emergency exit network
- Facility adds acoustic dampening to their quarters

### If Negotiated
- Mephit friendship
- Possible "Thunder Note" cantrip
- Information about other chambers
- Warning about deeper dangers

## Quick Resolution Guide

### Fast Version (Running Low on Time)
