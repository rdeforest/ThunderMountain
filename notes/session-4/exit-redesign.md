# Session 4 Exit Redesign

## Console Exit Control

### When Party Requests Exit Options
Console displays:
```
FACILITY EGRESS OPTIONS:
1. PRIMARY ENTRANCE - STATUS: CONTESTED
   - Geological hazards detected
   - Modron security engaging
   - Clearance time: 7 days
   
2. MAINTENANCE ACCESS SHAFT-7 - STATUS: OBSTRUCTED
   - Crystalline parasites detected
   - Manual clearance required
   - Distance to surface: 147 meters
   
3. RESONANCE TESTING BAY - STATUS: DEGRADED
   - Elemental contamination present
   - Acoustic hazards active
   - Emergency exit functional

SELECT EXIT FOR PRIORITY CLEARANCE? [Y/N]
```

## Exit 1a: Owlbear Territory (LEFT from entrance)

### The Blockage
**Ancient Landslide** - Triggered by recent bulette activity
- Completely impassable without days of digging
- Console reads: "GEOLOGICAL OBSTRUCTION - CLEARANCE TIME: 14 DAYS"
- Owlbears on other side (can hear them, can't reach them)

### Alternative Challenge
If they insist on going this way:
- Must traverse **The Old Mining Gallery**
- Partially flooded from underground spring
- **Water Weirds** (2) have taken residence
- Water has trace minerals that glow blue (tie to facility)
- Cold exposure rules apply

## Exit 1b: Active Bulette Purge (RIGHT from entrance)

### The Active Battle Scene
When party arrives:
- 3 Modrons (2 duodrones, 1 tridrone) fighting
- 1 Adult bulette defending eggs
- 2 Juvenile bulettes harrying modrons

### Battle Balance
**Current State**: Evenly matched
- Modrons have tactics and regenerating shields
- Bulettes have home advantage and desperation
- Without party: Facility wins in 7 days
- With party: Can tip balance immediately

### Modron Dialogue
Tridrone: "ADMINISTRATORS DETECTED. REQUESTING TACTICAL ASSISTANCE. GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS PREVENTING OPTIMAL PURGE EFFICIENCY."

### If Party Helps
- Modrons focus on juveniles
- Party faces adult with modron support fire
- Victory = immediate safe passage

### If Party Doesn't Help
- Must find another exit
- Can return in 7 days when clear

## Exit 3: Resonance Testing Bay (Complete Redesign)

### What It Actually Is
A quality control chamber where finished items were tested for proper resonance frequencies. Makes engineering sense!

### The Physical Layout
**Single Large Chamber** with:
- Acoustic focusing dishes on walls (parabolic reflectors)
- Testing pedestals at specific harmonic nodes
- Emergency exit at far end (one-way acoustic valve)
- Thunder mephits nesting in the focusing dishes

### The Engineering Challenge
**The Problem**: Mephits have disrupted the harmonic nodes
- Room constantly reverberates at wrong frequency
- Causes disorientation (CON save DC 12 or disadvantaged)
- Need to restore proper resonance to reach exit

### The Actual Puzzle (Thunder will appreciate this)
**Constructive/Destructive Interference**:
1. Three testing pedestals create standing waves
2. Must activate in sequence to create null point at exit
3. Wrong sequence = constructive interference (thunder damage)
4. Right sequence = destructive interference (silence at exit)

**The Clue**: Forge-touched items naturally resonate
- Carl and Trumpet vibrate at different frequencies
- Place them on correct pedestals
- Third pedestal needs something else (Thunek's gear? Improvised solution?)

### Why This Makes Sense
- Quality control needs precise acoustics
- Standing wave patterns for testing resonance
- Emergency exit designed to be silent (safety feature)
- Mephits attracted to acoustic energy

## Food Situation Tracker

### Current Status (Start of Session 4)
- Day 3 without food
- Stomachs growling
- No exhaustion yet

### Starvation Timeline
**Constitution Days Before Exhaustion**:
- Thunek: 1 day (CON +1)
- Songbird: 1 day (CON +1)  
- Smol: 2 days (CON +2)
- Seraphina: 2 days (CON +2)

### Facility Food Options
**Primus-3R's Garden**:
- Edible moss (tastes terrible, counts as food)
- "Nutritious but disappointing"
- 1 day's rations per person available

**Mountain Spring Water**:
- Roll d20 when drinking:
  - 1-10: Normal water
  - 11-15: Slightly energizing (+1 temp HP)
  - 16-19: Trace minerals (advantage on next CON save)
  - 20: Magical refreshment (counts as half ration)

## Facility Territory Definition

### What It Claims
- Original volcanic cone (pre-erosion)
- All lava tubes and natural caves
- 500-foot radius from original caldera
- Red lights mark boundary claims

### Visual Indicators
- **Blue traces**: Internal guidance/maintenance
- **Red markers**: Territorial boundary
- **Green pulses**: Active clearing operations
- **White flashes**: Administrator location beacon

## Console Priority Commands

### If Party Selects Priority Exit
"PRIORITY CLEARANCE INITIATED. ESTIMATED TIME:"
- Exit 1b: "2 HOURS - DEPLOYING ADDITIONAL UNITS"
- Exit 2: "MANUAL CLEARANCE REQUIRED - PROVIDING TACTICAL DATA"
- Exit 3: "HARMONIC RECALIBRATION NEEDED - UPLOADING FREQUENCIES"

### Facility Assistance Options
Each exit can be made easier by:
- Requesting modron backup (takes 30 minutes to arrive)
- Activating emergency protocols (uses lots of power)
- Downloading tactical data (reveals enemy weaknesses)

## Opening Reminder Script
"So, quick mechanical note before we start - leveling up includes a long rest, which means you're on day 3 without food. Nobody's exhausted yet, but..." 
*Make stomach growling sound*
"Your characters are definitely feeling hungry. Thunek and Songbird will start facing exhaustion tomorrow if you don't find food."
