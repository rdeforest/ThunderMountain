## Encounter Difficulty Reality Check

With these magic items, the party is effectively Level 4.5:

### Adjusted Encounter Ratings
- **Primus-3R** (600 XP): Trivial unless surprised
- **Cave Fishers** (1,750 XP): Medium-Hard (Shatter vulnerability)
- **Bulette Fight** (2,000 XP): Hard-Deadly (as intended)
- **Mephit Sovereign** (2,200 XP): Hard if fought, Easy if negotiated

### Resource Management Check
By Session 4, they've probably used:
- Some spell slots from previous encounters
- Bardic Inspiration uses
- Lay on Hands HP
- Possibly some Hit Dice during short rests

This resource depletion is important for maintaining challenge!

## Quick DM Reference

### If Too Easy, Remember:
- Thunek's bow makes him very accurate
- Smol has encounter-ending spells
- They have magic items now
- Add environmental complications

### If Too Hard, Remember:
- Sovereign is negotiable
- Facility can intervene
- They're administrators (use it!)
- Environmental advantages exist

### Magic Item Interactions:
- **Staff of Fire vs Thunder Mephits**: Fire doesn't work well (flavor tension!)
- **Resonance Weapons**: Both trumpet and Carl vibrate near forge-touched items
- **Thunek's Accuracy**: Nearly guaranteed hits change action economy
- **Enhanced Trumpet**: Rerolls can completely change critical moments
