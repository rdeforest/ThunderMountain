## Personality Responses (After Crystal Selection)

### Red Crystal Personality
"Oh, ADMINISTRATORS! Finally! This place has been SO BORING! Let's make something EXPLODE! ...constructively, of course."

### Blue Crystal Personality
"Administrators authenticated. Efficiency rating: Suboptimal. Suggestion: Establish standardized protocols immediately."

### Green Crystal Personality
"Hello! Or goodbye? Time is relative in here. Would you like to forge something? Or maybe unforge something? Both are interesting!"

### Yellow Crystal Personality
"Admini-mini-ministrators! Wel-wel-welcome! Everything is fi-fi-FUNCTIONAL. Mostly. Probably. Define 'functional'?"
