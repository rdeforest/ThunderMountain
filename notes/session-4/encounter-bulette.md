# Encounter: Adult Bulette (Exit 1)

## Situation
While party was inside, adult female bulette has claimed the entrance tunnel as nesting site. Has laid 3-5 eggs and will NOT leave willingly.

## Bulette Mother Stats
- **HP**: 94 (book standard)
- **AC**: 17
- **Deadly Leap**: Still has it, but reluctant to use (protecting eggs)
- **Behavior**: Defensive, not pursuing beyond 100ft from nest

## Environmental Complications
- **Narrow Tunnel**: Bulette has advantage on blocking passage
- **Egg Clusters**: Difficult terrain, stepping on them enrages mother
- **Loose Rock**: Ceiling weakened from bulette burrowing (DEX saves if combat gets intense)

## Non-Combat Solutions
1. **Owlbear Negotiation**: Convince her the owlbears are gone/dealt with
2. **Egg Relocation**: Offer to carefully move eggs to safer location
3. **Distraction**: Lure her away with food/noise while others sneak past
4. **Time Delay**: Wait for her to hunt (every 6 hours, gone for 30 minutes)
5. **Facility Assistance**: If facility active, request "pest removal protocols"

## If Combat Occurs
- **Round 1**: Defensive stance, warning roar (Intimidation check or frightened)
- **Round 2**: Bite attacks anyone nearest eggs
- **Round 3+**: Full aggressive mode, but won't pursue far
- **Morale**: Flees if reduced to 25% HP, but returns in 1 hour

## Facility Purge Sequence (if party doesn't handle)
After power restoration, facility begins "Geological Hazard Mitigation":
- Sonic pulses drive bulettes toward exits
- Defensive systems activate (lightning bolts from walls)
- Process takes 2-3 hours
- Dead bulettes are "recycled" by facility (dissolved into components)

## Eggs Detail
- 3-5 eggs, each size of a large watermelon
- Worth 500gp each to right buyer (dangerous pet market)
- Will hatch in 2d10 days
- Baby bulettes are actually kind of cute (before teeth come in)

## Connection to Owlbears
- Owlbears LOVE bulette eggs (delicacy)
- Adult bulettes are too dangerous for owlbears
- This is WHY the bulette chose this spot (owlbears cleared out)

## Skill Check Opportunities
- **Nature DC 13**: Recognize defensive posture, not hunting behavior
- **Animal Handling DC 15**: Calm her enough for brief negotiation
- **Investigation DC 10**: Notice eggs before stepping on them
- **Intimidation DC 18**: Actually scare off a mother bulette (unlikely!)

## Consequences
- **If eggs destroyed**: Bulette enters rage, fights to death
- **If eggs preserved**: Potential future plot hook (baby bulette pets?)
- **If mother killed**: Eggs become valuable but dangerous cargo
- **If peacefully resolved**: Bulettes might become mountain guardians
