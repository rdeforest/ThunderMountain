# Encounter: Maintenance Shaft (Exit 2)

## Path Description
Vertical maintenance tunnels behind forge, designed for dwarven/gnomish workers. Partially collapsed but navigable.

## The Crystalline Cave Fishers
Modified cave fishers that have been feeding on forge energy for centuries.

### Cave Fisher Stats (Modified)
- **HP**: 22 each (3 total)
- **AC**: 14
- **Filament**: 60ft range, DC 13 STR to break free
- **Thunder Conductivity**: Anyone caught by filament takes 1d4 lightning damage/round
- **Crystalline Shell**: Vulnerable to thunder damage (double damage)

## Climbing Challenges
1. **Initial Ascent**: 40ft vertical, Athletics DC 12 or fall (2d6 damage)
2. **Collapsed Section**: Squeeze through rubble, DEX save DC 13 or get stuck
3. **Slippery Crystal Growth**: Disadvantage on climbing checks
4. **Final Shaft**: 60ft with cave fishers at top

## Environmental Hazards
- **Unstable Sections**: Loud noises trigger small rockfalls (1d4 bludgeoning)
- **Crystal Dust**: CON save DC 11 or coughing fit (disadvantage on stealth)
- **Narrow Spaces**: Medium creatures have disadvantage on combat rolls
- **Complete Darkness**: No natural light sources

## Cave Fisher Tactics
- Fisher 1: Waits at shaft top, filament ready
- Fisher 2: Hides in side alcove midway up
- Fisher 3: Patrols, arrives round 3 of combat

## Solutions & Strategies
1. **Thunder Damage**: Songbird's Shatter spell devastates them
2. **Distraction**: Use light/sound to lure them away
3. **Speed Climbing**: Rush past before they react
4. **Facility Control**: Request "Maintenance Shaft Clearance Protocol"

## Treasure (in fisher nest)
- Crystallized dwarven skeleton wearing:
  - Climber's kit (grants advantage on 3 climbing checks)
  - Sending stone (paired stone is in Phandalin)
  - 45 gp in old dwarven coins

## Skill Opportunities
- **Investigation DC 12**: Find handholds that avoid fisher sightlines
- **Nature DC 14**: Know that cave fishers fear thunder damage
- **Acrobatics DC 15**: Swing past on fisher filament like rope
- **Perception DC 10**: Hear fishers clicking before seeing them

## Exit Point
- Emerges on north face of Thunder Mountain
- 8 miles from Phandalin (closer than main entrance)
- Hidden by illusory boulder (detectable, DC 15 Investigation)

## Time Pressure
If they take too long (>30 minutes real time):
- Facility begins "Maintenance Protocol"
- Shaft starts venting hot air (1 fire damage/round)
- But also weakens cave fishers (disadvantage on attacks)

## If Combat Goes Bad
- Thunek has climbing gear and can help
- Seraphina suggests using echo properties against them
- Last resort: Facility emergency evacuation (but locks this exit permanently)
