# Facility Knowledge Tracker

## What the Party Knows So Far

### About the Facility
- Joint dwarven-gnomish construction
- Requires power crystals to operate
- Has a forge that can enhance items
- They are registered as administrators
- Blue traces are guidance/maintenance paths
- Something caused emergency shutdown years ago

### About the Forge
- Called "Forge of Echoing Thunder"
- Can enhance items with resonance properties
- Requires rhythmic harmony between music and strikes
- Creates items that resonate with each other
- Currently limited to basic enhancements

### About the Power System
- Crystals vibrate at specific frequencies
- Power gatherers convert vibrations to usable energy
- Different crystals have different "personalities"
- Need minimum 2 crystals for basic operation
- More crystals unlock more capabilities

### About the Security Systems
- Facility was in "hardened mode" while powered down
- Can detect and purge unwanted creatures (bulettes)
- Recognizes administrators for privileged access
- Has modron servants/guardians
- Can be controlled from central console

## What They DON'T Know Yet

### The Missing Component
- "Administrator Crown" not detected
- Facility ownership transfer incomplete
- Something crucial is [DATA CORRUPTED]
- This prevents full operation

### The Deeper Mystery
- Why was this facility really built?
- What's the incomplete construction Primus mentioned?
- Why does it need to scan the surrounding area?
- What were they forging here originally?

### The Second Forge
- There might be another forge deeper down
- Construction was paused during emergency
- The "thunder" might be from active deeper systems
- The facility is bigger than they realize

### The Original Operators
- Who were the dwarves and gnomes working together?
- Why did they abandon it?
- What emergency caused the shutdown?
- Where did they go?

## Facility Systems Status

### Online
- Basic lighting and life support
- Console interface
- Administrator recognition
- Forge basic operation (with 2 crystals)
- Perimeter monitoring

### Partially Online
- Security systems (purging bulettes)
- Modron servants (some corrupted)
- Internal defenses
- Communication systems

### Offline
- Advanced forging capabilities
- Full facility transformation
- Deep level access
- Ownership transfer protocols
- [CLASSIFIED] systems

## Console Messages They've Seen
- "ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS GRANTED"
- "POWER LEVELS: CRITICAL"
- "RESONANCE CRYSTALS REQUIRED"
- "HARMONIC CALIBRATION IN PROGRESS"
- "ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE"

## Console Messages Available This Session
- "ADMINISTRATOR CROWN - NOT DETECTED"
- "FACILITY OWNERSHIP TRANSFER - INCOMPLETE"
- "PEST REMOVAL PROTOCOL - AVAILABLE"
- "MAINTENANCE SHAFT ACCESS - GRANTED"
- "ECHO GALLERY - RESONANCE LOCK DISENGAGED"

## Important Item Interactions
- Carl resonates with forge-touched items
- The trumpet will vibrate near other enhanced items
- Enhanced items can "find" each other within 30 feet
- The forge remembers what it has enhanced

## Questions Players Might Ask

### "Can we enhance other items?"
- Not with current power levels
- Weapons/armor need 3 crystals minimum
- Some items would be destroyed by enhancement

### "Who built this?"
- Joint dwarven-gnomish project
- Dates back approximately 200 years
- Part of larger network (?)

### "Can we claim ownership?"
- Missing Administrator Crown
- Incomplete transfer protocols
- Would need to find original documentation

### "Is it safe to use?"
- Mostly, with administrator access
- Some systems still corrupted
- Unknown what full activation might trigger

### "Are there other facilities?"
- Console hints at network connections
- Mentions "Node 3-7" in some messages
- Regional scanning suggests checking for others

## Breadcrumbs for Future Sessions
- The Administrator Crown (what is it, where is it?)
- The incomplete construction in deeper levels
- Network of similar facilities
- The original builders' fate
- What the facility was really forging
- Connection to the Bean family history
- Why Smol's grandmother is worried
