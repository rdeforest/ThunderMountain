# Carl & Trumpet Resonance Mechanics

## Basic Resonance (Always Active)
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Effect**: Both vibrate slightly
- **Mechanical**: Disadvantage on Stealth checks when together
- **Visual**: Faint blue shimmer between them occasionally

## Location Awareness
- **Range**: 120 feet  
- **Function**: Each always knows direction and distance to the other
- **Usage**: No action required, just awareness
- **Blocked By**: 5 feet of stone, 1 foot of metal, or magical barriers

## Combined Use Options

### 1. Resonant Silence (Once per Day)
- **Activation**: Bonus action by either user
- **Effect**: 10-foot radius silence field
- **Duration**: 1 round (6 seconds)
- **Visual**: Air shimmers like heat waves
- **Tactical**: Perfect for sneaking past guards or stopping verbal spells

### 2. Echo Location (Ritual, 10 minutes)
- **Requirements**: Songbird plays trumpet while Smol concentrates with Carl
- **Effect**: Reveals all creatures and objects within 60 feet, even through walls
- **Duration**: Instantaneous snapshot
- **Limitation**: Causes loud reverberations, alerts everyone in 300 feet

### 3. Harmonic Shield (Reaction, Once per Long Rest)
- **Trigger**: When one user is hit by an attack
- **Effect**: Both users gain +2 AC until start of next turn
- **Visual**: Blue energy arc between them
- **Cost**: Both use their reaction

### 4. Thunderous Rebuke (When Both Take Damage)
- **Trigger**: Both damaged by same area effect
- **Effect**: 15-foot thunder pulse, 2d4 damage, STR save DC 13 or pushed 10 feet
- **Frequency**: Once per combat
- **Description**: Their resonance explodes outward reflexively

### 5. Fate Echo Amplification (When Trumpet Uses Reroll)
- **Passive Effect**: If Carl within 30 feet when trumpet rerolls
- **Benefit**: Can choose to reroll either die (if rolling with advantage/disadvantage)
- **Visual**: Carl glows in sync with trumpet
- **Limitation**: Still uses one of trumpet's charges

## Improvised Uses (Player Creativity)

### If Players Try Something Logical
- **Rule of Cool**: If it makes sense with resonance/echo theme, allow it
- **Power Level**: Should be equivalent to a cantrip or 1st level spell
- **Cost**: Might use trumpet charge or spell slot
- **Examples**:
  - Use resonance to shatter glass (once per day)
  - Send simple message through sympathetic vibration
  - Detect other echo-touched items within 30 feet
  - Harmonize to grant advantage on one Performance check

### If Players Get Too Creative
- **Feedback Loop**: Too much resonance causes 1d4 psychic damage to both users
- **Overload**: Both items go "silent" for 1 hour
- **Facility Response**: If in mountain, triggers security ("UNAUTHORIZED HARMONIC MANIPULATION")

## Evolution Potential (Future Sessions)
As they learn more about the facility:
- Unlock new resonance frequencies
- Increase range of effects
- Add more items to the resonance network
- Learn to "tune out" the disadvantage on Stealth

## Story Integration
- Other forge-touched items will recognize the resonance
- Modrons consider this "proper authorization"
- The Bean family grandmother will immediately notice
- Certain magical creatures are attracted to or repelled by it

## DM Notes
- Keep it simple unless players push for complexity
- The resonance is meant to be fun, not game-breaking
- If they never use it together, that's fine
- If they abuse it, introduce "resonance fatigue"
