## Key Information

### What's Missing from Facility
- "Enhancement Multiplexer" - allows multiple enhancements per item
- Located in incomplete second forge area (future session hook)

### Why It Matters
- Players are now administrators of ancient magical facility
- Mountain becomes their base/treehouse
- Modrons will be loyal to them
- Sets up larger campaign arc about facility's purpose

### NPC Motivations
- **Primus-3R**: Wants garden to be appreciated
- **Bulette**: Protecting eggs from owlbears
- **Cave Fishers**: Hungry, defending territory
- **Mephits**: Want the noise to stop
- **Thunek**: Document everything for his book
- **Seraphina**: Academic discovery of lifetime

## Difficulty Management

### Too Easy?
- Add time pressure
- Environmental hazards activate
- Second wave of enemies

### Too Hard?
- NPC assistance available
- Facility offers help
- Environmental advantages appear

## Important Reminders
- Day 3 without food - exhaustion starts tomorrow for low CON characters
- Console controls all exits and shows threat assessments
- Track which crystal they choose (affects forge personality forever)
- First trumpet reroll is dramatic moment
- Carl resonance kicks in after enhancement
- Facility considers entire volcanic cone its territory
- Red boundary lights, blue guidance traces
- This is discovery, not completion - sanctuary building
