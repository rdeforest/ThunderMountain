## Quick Combat Reference

### Mephit Tactics
- Regular mephits swarm and use Thunder Breath when recharged
- They flee when sovereign is defeated or negotiated with
- Death Bursts can chain-reaction if killed close together
- They hover out of melee reach when possible

### Sovereign Personality
**Combat Quotes:**
- "You make BAD NOISE! We make GOOD NOISE!"
- "This is BOOM-BOOM home! You leave!"
- "Thunder is OURS! Mountain speaks to US!"

**Negotiation Quotes:**
- "Pretty sound... we listen..."
- "You stop big thunder? We want quiet sometimes..."
- "Music... music better than BOOM-BOOM..."

### Environmental Interaction
- Mephits hide in the parabolic dishes (3/4 cover)
- Sovereign can use dishes to amplify Thunder Pulse (increase radius to 30 ft)
- If Songbird uses Shatter spell, all mephits are frightened for 1 round (they respect thunder magic)

## Party Adjustments with Magic Items

### Thunek's Bow
- **+2 to hit, +1 damage** makes him very reliable
- Can hit mephits even with cover
- Sneak attack (2d6) from hiding in acoustic shadows

### Seraphina's Staff
- If it's Staff of Fire, she's less effective here (thunder immunity)
- But +1 to melee attacks still helps
- Divine Smite works regardless of damage type

### Tactical Notes
- Sovereign is negotiable - combat is optional!
- Regular mephits are minions - should go down quick
- Death Burst deafness matters for communication after fight
- This encounter is about resource drain before final escape
