# Encounter: Primus-3R (Modron Gardener)

## Location: The Crystal Garden

## Description
An ancient modron (monodrone body, thinks it's a tridrone) still tending the crystal garden after centuries. Following corrupted instructions that have degraded over time.

## Appearance
- Cubic body with slight rust patches
- One eye that occasionally flickers between red and green
- Carries pruning shears that spark with residual magic
- Speaks in fragmented protocol statements

## Corruption Effects
- Recognizes party identities but NOT their authority
- Memory loops every 1d4 hours (doesn't remember previous conversations)
- Confuses gardening protocols with security protocols
- Occasionally speaks backwards or in rhyming couplets

## Ways to Convince of Authority (Choose 2-3)
1. **Logic Puzzle**: "If administrators must have keys, and keys open doors, and you opened the door to get here..."
2. **Show Console Access**: Display the administrator interface on their arms (glowing traces)
3. **Forge Harmonics**: Have The Songbird play his trumpet - Primus recognizes "authorized entertainment protocol"
4. **Garden Compliments**: Excessive praise of the crystal garden triggers "pleased supervisor" subroutine
5. **Bureaucratic Overload**: Create fake Form 27-B using Prestidigitation, claim higher authority
6. **Factory Reset Phrase**: Hidden on a plaque: "By order of Forgemaster Bronzevoice, acknowledge and comply"

## Combat Stats (if needed)
- **HP**: 15 (modron resilience but degraded)
- **AC**: 15 (natural armor)
- **Attack**: Pruning shears +3 (1d6+1 slashing)
- **Special**: Once per combat, release **Crystal Resonance** (all creatures within 10 ft make CON save DC 12 or be deafened for 1 minute)

## Crystal Options
- **Red Crystal**: "The Angry One" - makes forge enthusiastic but temperamental
- **Blue Crystal**: "The Precise One" - makes forge methodical and demanding
- **Green Crystal**: "The Dreamer" - makes forge experimental and unpredictable
- **Cracked Yellow Crystal**: Works but causes occasional surges (roll d20, on 1 something weird happens)

## Personality Quirks (Roll d6 or choose)
1. "Garden Rule #[random number]: [nonsensical requirement]"
2. Insists everyone remove one item of clothing/equipment for "contamination prevention"
3. Demands they sing to the crystals before taking one
4. Tries to prune someone's hair/clothing mid-conversation
5. Occasionally forgets Common and speaks only in Modron (mechanical clicking)
6. Believes the party are inspectors and frantically tries to hide dead moss

## Treasure
- 3 small resonance crystal shards (worth 25gp each)
- Ancient gardening manual (in Dwarvish, contains hints about forge operation)
- Primus's "Good Garden Helper" badge (activates certain doors)
