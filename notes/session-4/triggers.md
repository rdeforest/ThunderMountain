# Session 4 Event Triggers

## Mountain Awakening Sequence

### Trigger Condition
All three administrators (party members) exit the facility together.

### Immediate Effects (The "Car Lock")
1. **Audio**: Deep THRUM-thrum... THRUM-thrum (like locking beep)
2. **Visual**: Blue trace lines pulse twice, then fade to steady glow
3. **Duration**: 10 seconds
4. **Radius Effect**: All ferrous metal within 5 miles vibrates once

## Reboot Sequence (First Hour After Activation)

### MRI/Radar Sweep Pattern
Every 10 minutes for first hour:
1. **Pulse 1**: Low frequency - large iron objects resonate (swords, armor)
2. **Pulse 2**: Medium frequency - medium objects (daggers, horseshoes)
3. **Pulse 3**: High frequency - small objects (nails, coins)
4. **Visible Range**: Blue pulse visible for 1 mile
5. **Audible Range**: Humming heard for 3 miles

### Calibration Differences
- First sweep: 150% normal power (very obvious)
- Second sweep: 120% power
- Third+ sweeps: 100% power (normal operations)

## Facility Security Mode Progression

### If Bulette Defeated
- Facility easily destroys remaining juveniles
- Process completes before party surfaces
- Mountain goes completely silent
- Blue traces remain dimly visible

### If Bulette Not Defeated
- "Geological Hazard Mitigation Protocol" activates
- Takes 2-3 hours
- Sounds different from before (organized, rhythmic)
- Occasional screeches as bulettes are purged

## Owlbear Behavioral Changes

### Immediate (Upon Thunder Stopping)
- Exit any interior spaces
- Gather at cave entrances
- Feast on escaping juvenile bulettes

### Long-term (Post Session)
- Become informal mountain guardians
- Remember party kindness from Session 2
- Will warn of intruders but not attack party

## Town Reactions (If Party Reaches Phandalin)

### First Wave (Immediate)
- Metal objects pointing toward mountain
- Townsfolk gathering in streets
- Grista: "What did you DO to my cookware?!"

### Second Wave (Within an hour)
- Cragmaw messenger arrives: "All weapons sing strange song!"
- Weapons are humming the same frequency
- Can be "tuned out" but returns each pulse

### Third Wave (Grandmother's Sending)
- **Timing**: When they're safely in town
- **Message**: "Scrying shows impossible readings. DO NOT FORGE ANYTHING until we speak. Coming immediately."
- **Implication**: She'll arrive next session

## NPC Decision Points

### Thunek's Choice
- **Trigger**: When exiting mountain
- **Decision**: Follows Seraphina
- **Quote**: "This... this needs to be documented. For my people."

### Seraphina's Decision
- **Trigger**: Reaching Phandalin
- **Statement**: "I must return to the university immediately with this data."
- **To Party**: "You've given us the discovery of the century."
- **Promise**: "I'll return with proper equipment and experts."

## Crystal Garden Outcomes

### Which Crystal They Choose
Track this - it affects:
- All future forge interactions
- NPC reactions to enhanced items
- Personality of any constructs they activate
- How the facility "speaks" to them remotely

### If They Take Multiple Crystals
- Forge personalities conflict
- Random personality each use
- Possible solution in second forge area

## Combat Escalation Triggers

### When to Increase Pressure
- If encounters too easy: Add environmental hazard
- If party split: Activate pursuit predator
- If too much planning: "Facility Maintenance Protocol begins in 5... 4..."

### When to Reduce Pressure
- If someone drops to 0 HP: Enemies focus on active threats
- If TPK likely: Thunek/Seraphina intervention
- If really stuck: Facility offers "assistance" (with personality)

## Special Item Interactions

### Carl + Trumpet First Resonance
- **When**: First time within 30ft after enhancement
- **Effect**: Both glow briefly, musical note plays
- **Mechanical**: Now aware of each other's location within 120ft

### Trumpet's First Reroll
- **Thunek's Reaction**: "The thunder... it CHANGED. You changed the thunder!"
- **Visual**: Shimmer in the air like heat waves
- **Audio**: Everyone hears both timelines' echoes

## Cliffhanger Timing

### If Exiting Before Hour 3
- Focus on journey back
- Random encounter with displaced wildlife
- Build tension about town's reaction

### If Exiting at Hour 3-3.5
- Quick travel montage
- Arrive at town for reactions
- End with Grandmother's sending

### If Exiting After Hour 3.5
- Mountain sequence only
- See the calibration from outside
- End with "What have we awakened?"

## Emergency Backup Triggers

### If They're Stuck in Crystal Garden
- Primus offers increasing hints
- Eventually just gives them a crystal
- "TAKE. GO. GARDEN NEEDS QUIET."

### If They Can't Beat Bulette
- Facility offers to help for a "favor"
- Owlbears arrive to help (remember healing)
- Bulette leaves to hunt

### If They're Lost in Echo Gallery
- Thunek finds alternate route
- Mephits offer to guide for music
- Facility emergency evacuation

## Session End Decision Tree
1. **Best Ending**: In town with sending received
2. **Good Ending**: Outside mountain seeing awakening
3. **Decent Ending**: Escaped but exhausted
4. **Cliffhanger Ending**: Still inside, something coming

Remember: This is the "no training wheels" session - let them feel real danger!
