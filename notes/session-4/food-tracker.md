- **Day After (Day 5)**: Smol & Seraphina gain exhaustion

## Available Food Sources

### Inside Facility

#### Primus-3R's Garden
- **Edible Moss**: Bitter, stringy, but nutritious
- **Amount**: 1 day's rations per person
- **Location**: Crystal Garden
- **Access**: Must convince/defeat Primus-3R
- **Quality**: "Technically food"

#### Hydroponics Bay (Not Yet Discovered)
- **Location**: Lower level (locked)
- **Contents**: Automated vegetable production
- **Status**: Still functional but needs repairs
- **Access**: Requires administrator privileges

#### Mountain Spring
- **Effect**: Roll d20 when drinking
  - 1-10: Normal water
  - 11-15: +1 temporary HP (energizing minerals)
  - 16-19: Advantage on next CON save
  - 20: Counts as half ration (magical nourishment)

### Outside Facility

#### If They Exit
- **Hunting**: Survival check DC 13 for small game
- **Foraging**: Nature check DC 12 for edible plants
- **Bulette Eggs**: If acquired, extremely nutritious (3 days rations per egg)
- **Return to Phandalin**: 8-12 miles depending on exit

## Exhaustion Rules Reminder

### Level 1 Exhaustion
- Disadvantage on ability checks
- Still combat-capable
- Noticeable fatigue

### Recovery
- Eating food and completing long rest removes 1 exhaustion
- Must eat BEFORE long rest to recover

## Starvation Roleplay Prompts

### Day 3 (Current)
- "Your stomach growls audibly"
- "That moss is starting to look appetizing"
- "You find yourself thinking about breakfast"

### Day 4
- "Your mouth feels dry despite the water"
- "Standing up too fast makes you dizzy"
- "Everything smells like food, even the rocks"

### Day 5+
- "Your hands shake slightly"
- "Concentration becomes difficult"
- "You're seriously considering eating Carl"

## Quick Decision Tree

### If Party Asks About Food
1. **In Garden**: Point out the moss
2. **At Console**: Option to search for "Nutritional Resources"
3. **Near Mephits**: They mention "green-grow below"
4. **Thunek**: Has emergency rations (1 day) he'll share

### If They Ignore Food
- Gentle reminders through description
- NPCs mention hunger
- But don't force it - exhaustion is survivable

## Strategic Considerations

### Why This Matters
- Creates urgency to leave or explore deeper
- Makes facility feel more real (infrastructure needs)
- Gives weight to "sanctuary" transformation
- Natural timer for session pacing

### Long-term Solution
Once they find hydroponics:
- Facility becomes true base
- Removes survival pressure
- Shifts focus to exploration/improvement
- Sets up "home base" feeling

## Session 4 Food Goals

### Minimum
- Acknowledge hunger
- Find Primus's moss
- Avoid immediate exhaustion

### Ideal
- Discover moss
- Learn about hydroponics
- Make plan for food security
- Exit to resupply if needed

### Bonus
- Find creative food solution
- Establish facility as future base
- Discover bulette eggs are edible
- Set up sustainable food source

## GM Reminders
- Don't be punitive about food
- It's a narrative tool, not a punishment
- One exhaustion level is manageable
- Focus on problem-solving, not suffering
- Let creative solutions work
