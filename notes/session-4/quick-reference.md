# Session 4 Quick Reference

## Opening Reminders
1. "No training wheels this session. Difficulty cranked up to DMG maximum. Real danger, real consequences."
2. "Quick note - leveling up = long rest, so you're on Day 3 without food. Stomachs are growling..."

## Core Session Goals
1. Find second crystal (Primus-3R encounter)
2. Enhance the trumpet at forge
3. Escape the mountain (3 dangerous exits)
