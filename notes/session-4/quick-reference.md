# Session 4 Quick Reference

## Opening Reminder
"No training wheels this session. Difficulty cranked up to DMG maximum. Real danger, real consequences."

## Core Session Goals
1. Find second crystal (Primus-3R encounter)
2. Enhance the trumpet at forge
3. Escape the mountain (3 dangerous exits)
4. Witness the mountain's awakening

## Exit Decision Tree
- **Bulette at main entrance**: Combat or negotiation
- **Cave Fishers in shaft**: Vertical combat challenge
- **Echo Gallery**: Sound puzzles and mephits

## Critical Mechanics

### Forge Enhancement
- Need 2 crystals minimum
- Pattern: DONG... dong-dong... DONG
- Performance DC 12 (advantage with smith's tools)

### Echo Gallery Chaos
- Roll d10 for each d20 rolled
- 1 = disadvantage, 10 = advantage
- Trumpet doesn't use charges here

### Mountain Awakening
- Triggers when all 3 party members exit
- THRUM-thrum pulse like car lock
- Blue traces visible on mountain
