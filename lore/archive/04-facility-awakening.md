## The Forge Enhancement
- **Songbird's Trumpet**: Successfully enhanced with Echoes of Fate ability
- **Forge Personality**: "The Dreamer" - experimental, tangential, philosophical
- **Carl Resonance**: Now resonates with the trumpet within 30 feet
- **Enhancement Limit**: One enhancement per item until Enhancement Multiplexer found

## The Mephit Encounter
- **Planning Time**: 30 minutes real-world discussion at kitchen table
- **Strategy**: Decided to fight rather than negotiate
- **Key Moment**: Songbird cast Command: Flee on sovereign
- **Resolution**: Sovereign fled into facility, encountered modrons
- **Seraphina**: Went down round 1, healed by Smol's comb

## Exit via Resonance Testing Bay
- **Path Taken**: Successfully navigated the acoustic chamber

## Return to Phandalin (Evening)
- **Mountain Status**: Lit up with blue traces and red boundary markers
- **Weapon Resonance**: All metal weapons in region humming
- **Cragmaw Report**: Their weapons all singing/resonating
- **Grandmother's Warning**: "DO NOT FORGE ANYTHING until we speak"
- **Party Reaction**: Shock at grandmother's message timing

## Facility Status Post-Session 4
- **Power Level**: Fully powered with redundant crystal
- **Security Mode**: Active, purging intruders
- **Construction**: Second forge project automatically resumed
- **Administrators**: All 4 party members recognized
- **Territorial Claim**: Entire original volcanic cone + 500m

## Ray the Wraith Engineer
- **Last Instructions**: Priority 1: Security, Priority 2: Complete second anvil
- **Current Status**: Facility following these instructions autonomously
- **Name Note**: "Ray" (sounds like wraith) instead of looking up canon name

## Promises Made
- **Bulette Purge**: Still available if party returns within 7 days
- **Maintenance Shaft**: Won't be cleared without them
- **Owlbear Training**: Implied possibility of making them security

## NPCs Departing
- **Thunek & Seraphina**: Heading to university to report

## Hooks Established
- **Crystal Growth**: Primus predicts next crystal ready in 12 weeks
- **Grandmother Incoming**: Responding to her warning
- **Regional Attention**: Mountain's light visible for miles
- **Tax Collectors**: Will want their share
- **Treasure Seekers**: Racing to claim facility
- **Modron Inspection**: Potential audit from Node 1-5
- **Noble Interest**: Including Songbird's family

## Party Achievements
- Gained Level 2 (total: Level 4)
- Acquired enhanced magical trumpet
- Became facility administrators
- Established Primus-3R as ally
- Avoided major combat through cleverness

## Unresolved Questions
- What does grandmother know about the forge?
- Who else has noticed the awakening?
- What is Ray's ultimate goal for the facility?
- Will the Cragmaws accept alliance invitation?
- Can owlbears actually be trained as security?

## Energy System Clarification
- Facility draws magical energy from planet itself (like tidal forces)
- "Infinite" source but limited by crystal capacity
- More crystals = wider energy pipeline
- Power used for construction, security, and enhancements
