# Thunder Mountain Campaign - Generated Lore

## Campaign Setting
- **Time Period**: Spring 1492 DR (one year after Jack's book was published)
- **Location**: Phandalin and surrounding territories, including Thunder Mountain
- **Tone**: Light, comedic, Pythonesque - think Monty Python meets D&D

## Thunder Mountain (formerly Wave Echo Cave area)
- Site of "dramatic events" years prior (Lost Mine of Phandelver events)
- Now called Thunder Mountain after "particularly dramatic failure" of last adventuring party
- Locals say you can still hear thunder on quiet nights
- Adults cross the street rather than walk on the side facing the peaks
- Children are told "the thunder will come for them" if they misbehave
- The Cragmaws abandoned their best mines there, leaving silver behind due to "something stomping around"

## The Construct Mystery
- Something is causing cave-ins in the abandoned mines
- Described as a "known unknown" - the Cragmaws know something is there but not what
- Possibilities discussed:
  - Abandoned dwarven/gnomish mining/research/defense equipment
  - An enormous, complicated lock (keeping something in or out?)
  - Something once above ground that became buried
  - Juvenile bulette, earth elemental with hiccups, or malfunctioning mining construct

## Jack Atabar Brightletter's Role
- Wants to hire adventurers to investigate Thunder Mountain
- "Nothing too dangerous... just want to know if there's remaining evidence"
- Will send an artist (Seraphina pivots from this role)
- Specifically interested in evidence of past attempts to obtain power/riches

## Seraphina Moonwhisper
- Jack's research assistant and linguistic expert
- Originally coming to research Cragmaw language evolution
- Pivots to Thunder Mountain exploration when she hears about the legendary trumpet
- Will suggest recruiting a Cragmaw scout
- Potential romance subplot with literate goblin scout

## The Cragmaw Goblins (established lore enhanced)
- Sophisticated society with concepts of trade and commerce
- Some speak and READ Common (breaking the "tribal" stereotype)
- Have a copy of Jack's book in their possession
- One goblin volunteer will have read it and want to study humans in return
- May want to write "What Your Pack Doesn't Tell You About Humans"

## The Bean Family
- High elf nobility, relieved when chaotic Smol ran away
- Grandmother is high-level wizard who scries on Smol weekly
- Official story: Smol "completely disappeared, likely to another plane"
- Will dispatch adventurers if Smol is in real danger (built-in rescue option)
- Parents will panic when they learn about the cave expedition

## Smol Bean's Military Background
- Served in local militia around 1489 (claiming to be a halfling)
- Dealt with minor threats: goblin "raids," wolves, bandits
- Main frustration: couldn't see over other casters for line of sight
- No specific trauma (keeping it light)
- Left angrier due to bureaucratic frustration and height jokes

## The Songbird's Family (name TBD)
- Family name unspecified for now. Kyle can pick one if he wants or I'll pick one if they get involved in the story before Kyle picks one
- Human nobility who believe he's their biological son
- Only The Songbird knows about the switch at birth
- They don't mind him wandering as long as he doesn't tarnish the family name
- They send him letters every two weeks (sometimes with money)
- They will scry him if he doesn't respond promptly enough and would probably send mercenaries to rescue him if he needed it or to try to drag him home against his will if they thought it in the best interest of the family.

## Grista Kattelecopp
- Proprietor of The Sleeping Giant Taproom
- First person Smol made laugh; they bonded instantly
- Hired Smol as security despite/because of her chaos
- Has a copy of Jack's book (given free as thanks for helping with research)
- Makes jokes about The Songbird's trumpet obsession

## Session Structure Plan
- Each session starts with Jack's lecture to his class (1495 DR)
- He's telling the story of "The Phandalin Incident"
- Mentions Seraphina brought a goblin back with her
- Students can interrupt with questions
- Provides natural recap and tone-setting

## The Legendary Trumpet
- Supposedly hidden in Wave Echo Cave
- The Songbird's primary motivation
- Known to locals through legend
- Grista jokes about using it to manipulate him

## Potential NPCs/Elements
- Literate goblin scout who takes academic notes
- Goblin romantic interest for Seraphina
- The artist Jack would have sent (role Seraphina abandons)
- Rescue party from Bean family (if needed)
- Courier system for noble family letters
