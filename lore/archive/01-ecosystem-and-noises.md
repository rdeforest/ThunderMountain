# Session 1 Generated Canon - Thunder Mountain Campaign

## Temporal Setting
- **Current Campaign Date**: Spring 1492 DR
- **Jack's Book Publication**: 1491 DR (one year prior)
- **Academic Framing**: Jack telling story to his class in 1495 DR (3 years after events)

## Thunder Mountain Ecosystem

### The Predator Chain & Territorial Dynamics
- **Bulettes**: Have always lived in the Thunder Mountain caves/underground areas
- **Recent Bulette Population Boom**: Thriving due to lack of hunting pressure (humans avoid the cursed mountain)
- **Bulette Activity**: Increased burrowing and movement has been triggering ancient magical defenses in Wave Echo Cave
- **Combined Noise Sources**: Bulette tunneling + ancient construct reactions = the "thunder" sounds that give the mountain its name

### Owlbear Hunting Patterns
- **Primary Territory**: Thunder Mountain area and cave entrances
- **Discovery**: Owlbears discovered young bulette pups are delicious prey
- **Territorial Advantage**: Surface = owlbear advantage, underground = bulette advantage
- **Ongoing Conflict**: Owlbears and bulettes fight for control of cave entrances
- **Extended Hunting**: When hungry, owlbears venture into Neverwinter Wood to hunt

### Displacement Effects
- **Giant Vultures**: Driven from Neverwinter Wood by hunting owlbears
- **Wolves**: Also displaced from forest, forced into plains
- **Boar Population**: Plains boars under increased predation pressure from displaced wolves
- **Ecological Cascade**: Mountain disturbance → forest displacement → plains overpredation

### Why Cragmaws Abandoned Mines
- "Something stomping around" in their best mines near Thunder Mountain
- Left silver behind rather than risk encounters
- Unwilling to compete with whatever was making the noises

## Geographic Landmarks
