# Thunder Mountain Ecosystem - Predator Cascade
**Status**: Disrupted | **Cause**: Facility awakening | **Effect**: Regional displacement

## The Noise Mystery Solved
- Bulette tunneling triggered ancient defenses
- Construct reactions + bulettes = "thunder" sounds
- This drove predators from mountain

## Current Predator Chain
1. **Bulettes**: Fled deep underground (Session 4)
2. **Owlbears**: Lost food source, descending mountain
3. **Wolves**: Pushed from forest to plains
4. **Boars**: Overhunted by displaced wolves

## Cascade Effects
- Mountain empty → Owlbears hungry
- Forest invaded → Wolves displaced
- Plains overhunted → Ecosystem collapse pending

## Resolution Options
- Restore balance (difficult)
- Redirect predators (temporary)
- Let nature adapt (brutal)
