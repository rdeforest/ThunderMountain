# Administrator Crown - Missing Component [C/R]
**Status**: Not detected | **Impact**: Ownership incomplete | **Location**: Unknown

## What Party Knows
- Console reports "Administrator Crown - NOT DETECTED"
- Prevents full facility ownership transfer
- Current admin status is temporary/limited
- Something crucial is [DATA CORRUPTED]

## Implications
- Can't access all facility functions
- Transfer protocols incomplete
- Deep levels remain locked?
- Full transformation unavailable

## Possible Locations [C/R]
- With original builders (fled)
- In deeper unexplored levels
- Destroyed in emergency shutdown
- Hidden by Ray for safety?

## Why It Matters
Without crown: Limited control only.
With crown: Full facility command.
