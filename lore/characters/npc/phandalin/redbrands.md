# Redbrands - Opportunistic Thugs
**Status**: Regrouping | **Base**: Ruined manor east of town

## Current Roster
- **Mosk "Red Eye"**: Leader, former soldier, missing left eye
- **Derrick & Tam**: Brothers, brutal but cowardly  
- **Silla**: Only woman, best fighter, wants leadership
- **Grenn**: Youngest, having second thoughts

## Current Knowledge
- Heard about mountain treasure from drunk townsfolk
- Know party went up, assume they found something
- Planning ambush for returning heroes

## Tactics
- Won't fight in town (too many witnesses)
- Prefer ambush on road or at camp
- Will flee if 2+ members fall

## Potential Outcomes
1. **Ambush party**: For assumed treasure
2. **Rob other travelers**: If party takes too long  
3. **Internal conflict**: Silla challenges Mosk
