# Mama Owlbear & Cubs - Displaced Predators
**Status**: Hunting new territory | **Location**: Descending Thunder Mountain

## Family Unit
- **Mama**: Battle-scarred, desperate, protective
- **Three cubs**: Adolescent size, hungry, learning to hunt
- **Disposition**: Not evil, just desperate for food/shelter

## Current Situation
- Lost mountain territory to facility vibrations
- Bulettes gone = no food source  
- Following game trails toward Phandalin
- Will raid farms if not redirected

## Potential Outcomes
1. **Violent**: Attack town, many die
2. **Redirect**: Party guides them to new territory
3. **Negotiate**: Cragmaws might accept them as guards?

## Combat Notes
Mama fights to death if cubs threatened.
Cubs flee if Mama drops below 20hp.
