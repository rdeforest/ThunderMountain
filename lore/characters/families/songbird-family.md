# Songbird's Noble Family - Name TBD
**Status**: Expecting letters | **Knowledge**: Think he's their biological son

## Family Dynamics
- Only Songbird knows about baby switch
- They support his wandering (within limits)
- Send letters biweekly (with money)
- Will scry if no prompt response

## Intervention Triggers
1. No letter response = scrying
2. Danger detected = mercenaries sent
3. Family reputation threatened = forced retrieval

## Letter System
- Courier network reaches Phandalin
- Expected response time: 2 weeks
- Missing one = concern
- Missing two = action

## Player Agency Note
Kyle can name family anytime.
Until then, refer as "your family" or "the nobles."
