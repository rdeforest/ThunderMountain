## The City of Luskan

### Overview and Demographics
Luskan, known as the "City of Sails," is a lawless port city on the northern Sword Coast. According to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, the city's population has declined from its former glory of 16,000 residents to approximately 4,000 following the Spellplague. The city operates without official taxes, instead funding itself through piracy, extortion, and trade fees.

### Government Structure: The Five Ships
The city is ruled by five pirate factions called "Ships," each commanded by a High Captain:
- **Ship Kurth**: Controls the docks, led by First High Captain Beniago Kurth (secretly a drow agent of Bregan D'aerthe)
- **Ship Baram**: Runs the fishing industry that feeds the city
- **Ship Suljack**: Coordinates most piracy operations
- **Ships Taerl and Rethnor**: Compete for remaining opportunities

### Notable Locations
- **The River Mirar**: Divides the city, connected by three bridges spanning five islands
- **Ruins of Illusk**: Ancient ruins beneath the city, haunted by undead
- **Dragon Beach**: Extremely dangerous area avoided even by soldiers
