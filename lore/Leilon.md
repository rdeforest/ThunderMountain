# Leilon and the Phandalin-Leilon Corridor: WotC Canon Reference

*This reference document compiles official Wizards of the Coast information about Leilon and the route from Phandalin, drawing from Storm King's Thunder, the D&D Essentials Kit adventures (Storm Lord's Wrath, Sleeping Dragon's Wake, Divine Contention), Lost Mine of Phandelver, and other canonical 5e sources.*

## The Town of Leilon

### Overview
Leilon is a small mining town that serves as a convenient resting place for travelers on the High Road along the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Waterdeep. According to official sources, it has undergone significant changes throughout its history.

### Population and Status
- **Historical Population**: Once a fortified settlement of some significance
- **Post-Spellplague**: Abandoned for over a century after the Spellplague
- **Current Status (1490s DR)**: Being rebuilt under Lord Neverember's patronage
- **Population**: Approximately 500-3,000 (sources vary based on timeframe)

### Location Discrepancies
Official maps show conflicting information about Leilon's exact location:
- **Some sources**: Directly on the coast
- **Other sources**: Slightly inland on the High Road
- **Reconciliation**: The town likely sits where the High Road runs very close to the coast, possibly with a harbor district extending to the water

## History of Leilon

### The House of Thalivar
- **Original Structure**: A wizard's tower built by the mage Thalivar centuries ago
- **Purpose**: Contained a planar beacon that trapped extraplanar creatures
- **The Spellplague (1385 DR)**: Corrupted the tower's defenses
  - Trapped creatures were released and attacked the town
  - The planar beacon's magic reversed, causing paralysis to those who looked upon it
  - Town was abandoned for over a century

### Recent History
- **1485 DR**: Lord Dagult Neverember ordered the tower torn down to support High Road trade
- **Late 1480s-1490s DR**: Rebuilding efforts begin
  - New settlers owe allegiance to Neverwinter
  - Town slowly repopulated
  - High Tower renamed "House of Thalivar"
